<<HENDER_25>>Lost Memories<<SPASE>>Lost Memories
<<START>>★I awoke in a frontier town called Casnan.<<END_STR>>
I seem to have lost all of my memories.<<END_STR>>
I can<27>t remember a thing, not even my own name.<<END_STR>>
★I met a burly man named Duren in the bar, who claims he<27>s <<END_STR>>
an information dealer. Apparently my name is <27>Adol<27> and I<<END_STR>>
was last seen heading into the <27>Great Forest.<27> What could<<END_STR>>
have happened to me there?<<END_STR>>
★Suddenly, we were told that monsters had appeared in the<<END_STR>>
mine. Duren went to investigate. He might know more about<<END_STR>>
my past, so I should probably follow him.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★I witnessed a group of miners rushing to the southwest<<END_STR>>
side of town. It seems that<27>s where the mine is.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★I arrived to find a huge commotion in front of the mine.<<END_STR>>
A woman who looked to be part of the army took control,<<END_STR>>
and I overheard that three miners are trapped inside.<<END_STR>>
★A strange light appeared, which only I can see.<<END_STR>>
I wonder what it is. <<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Upon touching the light, a number of different voices<<END_STR>>
resounded inside my head, some of which mentioned swords.<<END_STR>>
Could I have been a swordsman before I lost my memories?<<END_STR>>
If so, maybe I can help the miners...<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★I entered the mine and was followed by Duren. After<<END_STR>>
explaining what happened, he begrudgingly gave me a weapon<<END_STR>>
and agreed to help me out.<<END_STR>>
We should hurry to the depths of the mine!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★A strange stone monolith began emitting light when I<<END_STR>>
touched it. Unfortunately, it will have to wait.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We encountered a group of monsters, and I learned a new<<END_STR>>
skill. It should be useful in the battles ahead.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Duren taught me the importance of cooperating with allies<<END_STR>>
in battle. I<27>ll have to bear what he said in mind.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We encountered a group of Celcetan Army soldiers in<<END_STR>>
distress. After rescuing them, they agreed to leave the<<END_STR>>
mine. Apparently not all the soldiers in the Celcetan Army<<END_STR>>
have high morale. Regardless, the miners still need our <<END_STR>>
help. We should hurry.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We encountered a locked door. I wonder where the key is?<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Duren revealed that he knows how to force open locked<<END_STR>>
chests. That could prove useful!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We managed to unlock the door using the key we obtained.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We encountered the monster responsible for the incident<<END_STR>>
and defeated it, successfully rescuing the trapped miners.<<END_STR>>
★We bid the miners farewell as they left the mine.<<END_STR>>
...While we<27>re here, we should have a look around.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Inspecting a statue with wings, I heard a voice in my<<END_STR>>
head, like the one I heard at the entrance before.<<END_STR>>
I wonder whose it is? He seems to know my name...<<END_STR>>
★At the same time, I obtained a winged charm of some kind.<<END_STR>>
...We should probably be returning to the surface now.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★My Silver Wing reacted to the monolith. I<27>ll investigate.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★It seems I can warp between monoliths. So many strange<<END_STR>>
things are happening today. I should return to Casnan.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★As I left the mine, I was greeted by Governor General<<END_STR>>
Griselda and the miners we rescued. She showed us to her<<END_STR>>
office, saying she wanted to thank us personally.<<END_STR>>
★After thanking us, Governor General Griselda asked if we<<END_STR>>
would be interested in creating a map of the extremely <<END_STR>>
dangerous <27>Great Forest of Celceta<27> in exchange for a <<END_STR>>
large sum of money. I should give this some thought.<<END_STR>>
★We agreed to give our answer tomorrow after some rest.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_88>>The Great Forest<<SPASE>>The Great Forest
<<START>>★After leaving the Governor General<27>s office, we ran into<<END_STR>>
Commander Leo of the Celcetan Army, who<27>s quite<<END_STR>>
infamous around here. Just talking to him was exhausting.<<END_STR>>
★Duren suggested that we undertake the task of creating<<END_STR>>
the map together. His interest lies in the reward money,<<END_STR>>
while I need to enter the forest to regain my memories.<<END_STR>>
★After accepting his proposal, we agreed to visit the<<END_STR>>
Governor General the next day and begin preparing.<<END_STR>>
★Before we set off, Duren offered to give me a tour of<<END_STR>>
the main shops and facilities in Casnan. I should accept.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★According to Duren, the shadow of a large tree can be<<END_STR>>
seen to the northwest of Casnan, and a river runs through<<END_STR>>
the center of the Great Forest. This is all we know about<<END_STR>>
the forest. We should head for one of these landmarks.<<END_STR>>
★We can leave the town through the large northern gate.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★At the gate, we encountered Commander Leo again.<<END_STR>>
He has also agreed to work on a map of the Great<<END_STR>>
Forest. ...We should be leaving.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We began making our way across the plains between Casnan<<END_STR>>
and the Great Forest. Duren shared some useful pointers.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We discovered a spirit tree sapling at the entrance to<<END_STR>>
the forest. I was told enemies are unable to approach areas<<END_STR>>
where these saplings grow. We should rest here tonight.<<END_STR>>
★During the night, I regained one of my memories by way of<<END_STR>>
a vision. I saw a tower surrounded by thunderclouds.<<END_STR>>
Is that tower located somewhere in the Great Forest?<<END_STR>>
★Interestingly enough, resting near spirit tree saplings might<<END_STR>>
help recover my lost memories, so we should set up a tent<<END_STR>>
and rest whenever we find one.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We finally began our exploration of the Great Forest.<<END_STR>>
While here, I<27>ll need to be wary of status effects and<<END_STR>>
the passing of time.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★After escaping the Forest Labyrinth, I remembered <<END_STR>>
hearing about the history of the Great Forest from a <<END_STR>>
young man who could play the harp.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★After escaping the Misty Peak, I recalled crossing the<<END_STR>>
river on the back of a mysterious beast, with a blond man.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_129>>Spirited Away<<SPASE>>Spirited Away
<<START>>★We discovered a village built around a huge tree called<<END_STR>>
Comodo deep in the forest. Upon entering, however, we<<END_STR>>
were surrounded by armed villagers. I obviously visited<<END_STR>>
here once before, and I must have done something wrong.<<END_STR>>
★Karna, a hunter from the village, convinced the villagers<<END_STR>>
not to attack us. According to her, we met before I lost<<END_STR>>
my memories.<<END_STR>>
★We were taken to a hut in the village and tied up.<<END_STR>>
We should take this opportunity to rest, as being in the<<END_STR>>
village is at least safer than being in the Great Forest.<<END_STR>>
★That night, Karna and the village chief, Asad, came to<<END_STR>>
talk to us. Asad explained that villagers began vanishing<<END_STR>>
soon after I left. I can<27>t blame them for being suspicious<<END_STR>>
of me.<<END_STR>>
★As he left, he mentioned someone named Remnos.<<END_STR>>
...I wonder who that could be?<<END_STR>>
★Regardless, we aren<27>t going to get anywhere sitting in<<END_STR>>
here. Duren managed to free us, so we should look around<<END_STR>>
the village and see if we can uncover any information.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We began looking around the village to find clues and<<END_STR>>
trigger my memory. I<27>ll have to be careful not to be seen.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★After touching the mysterious light, I remembered my<<END_STR>>
previous visit to the town, including the fact that Remnos<<END_STR>>
is Karna<27>s younger brother and that a suspicious masked<<END_STR>>
person was sighted near the village when I left.<<END_STR>>
★After telling Karna and Asad all that I remembered, they<<END_STR>>
informed me that Remnos was one of the villagers who<27>d<<END_STR>>
been <27>spirited away<27> after my departure.<<END_STR>>
★We heard a strange noise outside, prompting Karna and<<END_STR>>
Asad to rush out and investigate. I should go take<<END_STR>>
a look as well.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Comodo was attacked by a group of masked warriors, who<<END_STR>>
appear to consist of the missing villagers. Asad was<<END_STR>>
seriously wounded by the strongest of the group.<<END_STR>>
★The attack left us with a number of important questions.<<END_STR>>
Why would the villagers attack Comodo? Where are they now?<<END_STR>>
With Asad wounded, we sought to investigate matters<<END_STR>>
ourselves, beginning by questioning the village residents.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We learned that someone was sighted entering a place<<END_STR>>
to the southwest of the village called the <27>Ancient<<END_STR>>
Burrow.<27> I should tell Karna about this.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Karna explained that she didn<27>t want to sit around and <<END_STR>>
do nothing while the village<27>s strongest warrior was<<END_STR>>
wounded, and Duren, Karna and I decided to go to the <<END_STR>>
Ancient Burrow. Its location is now marked on my map.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We<27>re at the Ancient Burrow, which we suspect is the<<END_STR>>
masked warriors<27> hideout. We should proceed with caution.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★A group of masked warriors lay in ambush, and we were <<END_STR>>
forced to fight. No doubt they were being controlled by<<END_STR>>
someone, as after defeating them they returned to their<<END_STR>>
senses. The culprit is likely deeper in the Burrow.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We opened a locked door deep within the Ancient Burrow<<END_STR>>
and were greeted by the familiar sound of a harp.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Inside, we found the warrior who wounded Asad, who was<<END_STR>>
revealed to be Remnos. He summoned a giant monster to<<END_STR>>
fight us, but we were able to emerge victorious.<<END_STR>>
★We discovered that Remnos had been under the control of<<END_STR>>
a <27>magician<27> who introduced herself as Bami. She revealed<<END_STR>>
that Remnos had always been a gifted warrior, but had<<END_STR>>
hidden his true potential to avoid hurting Karna. She<<END_STR>>
claimed to have used this fact to control him.<<END_STR>>
★Bami vanished, taking Remnos with her.<<END_STR>>
★We returned to Comodo and reported everything that had<<END_STR>>
happened to the newly-awakened Asad. The other villagers<<END_STR>>
who had been spirited away were returned to the village<<END_STR>>
safely, but we still knew nothing about Bami or the<<END_STR>>
experiment she mentioned. I<27>m worried about Remnos, too.<<END_STR>>
Hopefully Karna will cheer up...<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★On the way out of Comodo, we saw Commander Leo.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Now that we<27>ve done all we can in Comodo, we should head<<END_STR>>
for the river. Its location is marked on the map.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★The map is complete as far as the river. It might be a<<END_STR>>
good idea to return to Casnan and report to the<<END_STR>>
Governor General.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_207>>The Polluted River<<SPASE>>The Polluted River
<<START>>★We discovered a new village called Selray on the river.<<END_STR>>
The villagers weren<27>t very happy to see us,<<END_STR>>
and before we knew it we<27>d been locked in a hut.<<END_STR>>
★The guard informed us that someone had poisoned the<<END_STR>>
river, and as a result the villagers were currently unable<<END_STR>>
to fish. As an outsider who happened to visit the village<<END_STR>>
before this happened, I<27>m currently the prime suspect.<<END_STR>>
★The villagers have been using aquatic beasts<<END_STR>>
called <27>Spardas<27> to search the river for evidence.<<END_STR>>
That name sounds somewhat familiar to me...<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Upon touching a strange light, I remembered my first<<END_STR>>
meeting with Ozma, in which I asked him about the sacred<<END_STR>>
beasts called Spardas. Perhaps I might be able to<<END_STR>>
learn something if I can meet with him.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★As I was trying to persuade the guard to allow me to<<END_STR>>
meet Ozma, Ozma came to visit on his own. He suggested we<<END_STR>>
search for the real culprit to prove my innocence, and I<<END_STR>>
accepted his proposal.<<END_STR>>
★As long as he is with us, we should be able to gather<<END_STR>>
information in the village. We should start right away.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★According to the information we gathered, the villagers<<END_STR>>
noticed the poison when the river was dyed red. We learned<<END_STR>>
this occurred soon after I left the village, and the<<END_STR>>
poison came from upstream. To be able to dye a whole river<<END_STR>>
would take an enormous amount of poison -- could a human<<END_STR>>
really be responsible? It seems implausible.<<END_STR>>
★After our investigation, Ozma took us upstream and <<END_STR>>
revealed that the true culprits were the Spardas. It<<END_STR>>
appears that wild Spardas are known to spew poison.<<END_STR>>
However, the fact that they released so much of it<<END_STR>>
suggests something caused them to do so.<<END_STR>>
★Ozma decided to accompany us to the Spardas<27> habitat so<<END_STR>>
we can look into the matter. According to him, if we follow<<END_STR>>
the river to the south, the entrance can be found behind<<END_STR>>
a waterfall. Its location is now marked on the map.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Ozma told us that the Spardas<27> poison was responsible for<<END_STR>>
the death of his parents. As I thought, there was more to his<<END_STR>>
tribe and the story of the Spardas than he let on. <<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We defeated a giant monster and managed to save an infant<<END_STR>>
Sparda.<<END_STR>>
★Ozma is acting as if he has something on his mind. We <<END_STR>>
should pursue the infant Sparda.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We discovered that the reason the Spardas had been<<END_STR>>
releasing so much poison is that the infant Sparda had been<<END_STR>>
injured by a <27>beast tamer<27> named Gadis. Ozma attempted to<<END_STR>>
fight him, but Gadis<27> strength was too great. He managed<<END_STR>>
to get away, unfortunately.<<END_STR>>
★Eventually we were able to prove that I wasn<27>t the <<END_STR>>
culprit. Ozma says he intends to tell the villagers about<<END_STR>>
Gadis, but wants to keep the Spardas<27> role secret for now,<<END_STR>>
as he wishes to learn the truth about the Spardas and the<<END_STR>>
reason they<27>re revered as sacred beasts by his tribe.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★On the way out of Selray, we saw Commander Leo.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Now that we<27>ve done all we can in Selray, we should head<<END_STR>>
for the giant tree. Its location is marked on the map.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★The map is complete as far as the river. It might be a<<END_STR>>
good idea to return to Casnan and report to the<<END_STR>>
Governor General.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_268>>Return to Casnan<<SPASE>>Return to Casnan
<<START>>★We reported our progress to Governor General Griselda.<<END_STR>>
According to Duren, the other side of the river is known<<END_STR>>
as the <27>Primeval Lands,<27> and no one knows what lies there.<<END_STR>>
Unable to cross over, our investigation is at a standstill.<<END_STR>>
★The Governor General promised to let us know if she heard<<END_STR>>
anything, and recommended we rest in Casnan for now.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★After leaving the Governor General<27>s office, we met Gruda<<END_STR>>
of the Romun Army, who told us that he was sent from Romn<<END_STR>>
to serve as Governor General Griselda<27>s assistant.<<END_STR>>
★Duren and I discussed what to do next at the bar. So far,<<END_STR>>
we haven<27>t encountered the tower I saw in one of my<<END_STR>>
visions. Perhaps that tower is in the Primeval Lands?<<END_STR>>
If so, that means I found some way of getting across the<<END_STR>>
river before losing my memories.<<END_STR>>
★Duren and I agreed to work separately for a day, as he<<END_STR>>
wanted to meet an old friend. I should try and gather<<END_STR>>
information myself while completing quests in Casnan.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★There are two new quests on the board. Today is the<<END_STR>>
perfect opportunity to complete them.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★After completing both quests, I heard a rumor in the<<END_STR>>
plaza that something was happening near the north gate.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Approaching the commotion, I was reunited with Karna,<<END_STR>>
who<27>d climbed to the highest point in town to look for me.<<END_STR>>
★In the bar, Karna explained that she wants to come with<<END_STR>>
me to search for Remnos. It must have taken a lot of <<END_STR>>
determination to come this far through the Great Forest<<END_STR>>
alone to find me. I<27>m sure she<27>ll be a great help.<<END_STR>>
★Returning from meeting his old friend, Duren revealed<<END_STR>>
that he managed to get his hands on an old notebook of<<END_STR>>
mine. In it, we found the words <27>Primeval Lands<27> and<<END_STR>>
<27>Tower,<27> and discovered that I had probably crossed the<<END_STR>>
river previously by way of <27>Underground Ruins<27> with<<END_STR>>
their entrance located not far from Selray.<<END_STR>>
★We also found some strange symbols in the notebook.<<END_STR>>
I wonder what they mean?<<END_STR>>
★Duren, Karna and I set off for the Primeval Lands. First,<<END_STR>>
however, we decided to stop by Selray to see Ozma and<<END_STR>>
ask if he knows anything about these <27>Underground Ruins.<27><<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_309>>The Primeval Lands<<SPASE>>The Primeval Lands
<<START>>★We met with Ozma in Selray. Ozma told us that the Spardas<<END_STR>>
were originally from the Primeval Lands, and asked to<<END_STR>>
accompany us there so he could learn the truth about them.<<END_STR>>
★It seems the entrance to the Underground Ruins can be<<END_STR>>
reached by following the river to the north. Its location<<END_STR>>
is now marked on the map.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We reached the Underground Ruins mentioned in my<<END_STR>>
notebook, and began searching for the entrance.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We discovered some kind of device with a pattern similar<<END_STR>>
to the one in my notebook:<<END_STR>>
　　◆　◇　◆<<END_STR>>
　　◇　◇　◇<<END_STR>>
　　◆　◇　◆ <<END_STR>>
It makes me wonder...<<END_STR>>
Could the pattern in my notebook be related to the device?<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★After solving the puzzle, the entrance to the Underground<<END_STR>>
Ruins opened. Let<27>s go inside.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Inside the Underground Ruins, we discovered a winged<<END_STR>>
statue similar to the one I saw in Casnan. Perhaps the<<END_STR>>
statues have something to do with the Primeval Lands and <<END_STR>>
the kingdom which existed in Celceta eight hundred years<<END_STR>>
ago. Either way, we should keep moving.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We exited the Underground Ruins to find ourselves in a<<END_STR>>
new land. Near the exit, we found a gravestone with my <<END_STR>>
name on it. What<27>s going on around here?<<END_STR>>
★Karna also informed us that it didn<27>t appear anyone had<<END_STR>>
passed through the Underground Ruins recently. If that<27>s not<<END_STR>>
how I got to the Primeval Lands, then how DID I get here?<<END_STR>>
★...For now, we should focus on exploring the area.<<END_STR>>
There must be some kind of settlement nearby.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_342>>Recollections<<SPASE>>Recollections
<<START>>★We discovered a technologically advanced town and a tower<<END_STR>>
surrounded by thunderclouds. Could that be the tower<<END_STR>>
mentioned in my notebook? We should get a closer look at<<END_STR>>
the town first.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We reached the entrance to the town. It<27>s almost an<<END_STR>>
overwhelming sight up close. We should enter.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★As soon as the town<27>s residents saw me, they started<<END_STR>>
acting as if they<27>d seen a ghost. A girl named Calilica<<END_STR>>
showed us to the home of her grandfather, Mayor Aaron.<<END_STR>>
★The mayor explained that I was presumed dead by the<<END_STR>>
town<27>s residents. He was reluctant to share much more<<END_STR>>
information, however, and we were told to stay at his<<END_STR>>
mansion for the night.<<END_STR>>
★Calilica and the mayor seemed surprisingly unperturbed<<END_STR>>
by my memory loss. There appears to be something strange<<END_STR>>
about this town.<<END_STR>>
★So much has happened today, I can<27>t get to sleep. We were<<END_STR>>
told not to leave the mayor<27>s mansion, but...<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★I left the mansion through the window. I might as well<<END_STR>>
have a walk around town to clear my head.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★I saw a girl walking toward the cathedral.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Inside the cathedral, I remembered my first meeting with<<END_STR>>
someone called <27>Eldeel,<27> and was reunited with Leeza, a<<END_STR>>
girl who also featured in that memory.<<END_STR>>
★According to Leeza, Eldeel is like a god, and gives <<END_STR>>
people of his choosing special <27>wisdom.<27> At one point, I was<<END_STR>>
one of the people he summoned to receive such <27>wisdom.<27><<END_STR>>
It<27>s possible the protective barrier around this area may be<<END_STR>>
the reason I lost my memories. However, the barrier is only<<END_STR>>
intended to keep Eldeel and Highland a secret, so Leeza<<END_STR>>
can<27>t explain why I would<27>ve lost my other memories too.<<END_STR>>
★The next day, Calilica guided us around the town.<<END_STR>>
Hopefully I<27>ll be able to find something that will help<<END_STR>>
more of my memories return. We were given one rule during<<END_STR>>
our stay: we are not allowed to leave town by the north exit.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We went over the information we gathered exploring the<<END_STR>>
town, and concluded that to find out exactly what happened<<END_STR>>
here, we<27>re going to need to dig up my grave and unearth<<END_STR>>
my belongings.<<END_STR>>
★Let<27>s go and dig me up!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We dug up my grave, but my belongings were nowhere to be<<END_STR>>
seen. Instead, we found a torn scrap of paper with the<<END_STR>>
words, <27>Received the mask from<27> written on it. The words<<END_STR>>
are definitely in my handwriting.<<END_STR>>
★We concluded that the most likely possibility is that<<END_STR>>
someone stole my belongings, but lack enough information<<END_STR>>
to draw any conclusions about the <27>Mask<27> mentioned in the<<END_STR>>
memo. We<27>re going to need to meet Eldeel.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We asked the mayor about the possibility of meeting<<END_STR>>
Eldeel. Leeza informed us that, much to the surprise of<<END_STR>>
everyone in the room, he is currently unwell, so meeting<<END_STR>>
him won<27>t be possible right now.<<END_STR>>
★Sitting around isn<27>t going to get us anywhere,<<END_STR>>
so we decided to go to the tower and visit Eldeel anyway.<<END_STR>>
We<27>ll sneak out of the mansion tonight.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_400>>The Sanctuary<<SPASE>>The Sanctuary
<<START>>★We managed to sneak out of the mansion. To get to the<<END_STR>>
tower, we need to leave town through the north exit.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★After leaving town, we witnessed the violent weather<<END_STR>>
in the Sanctuary of Storms.<<END_STR>>
...We<27>ll have to go and get a closer look.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Resting in a camp in front of the Sanctuary of Storms,<<END_STR>>
I remembered spending time with Eldeel and Leeza.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We finally reached the Sanctuary of Storms. Looks<<END_STR>>
dangerous, but we can<27>t reach the tower without crossing<<END_STR>>
it, so we have no choice but to try our luck.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★After being struck by lightning, we returned to camp<<END_STR>>
and discovered we weren<27>t alone in the area -- Calilica<<END_STR>>
had followed us. Her face says she<27>s worried about Eldeel.<<END_STR>>
Convinced of her intentions by the courage she showed in<<END_STR>>
coming all this way, we agreed to let her accompany us.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Calilica<27>s amazing ability as an Apostle will allow us<<END_STR>>
to cross the Sanctuary of Storms. While it<27>s dangerous<<END_STR>>
nonetheless, we should be able to make it with her help.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We finally reached the tower. The elevator inside will<<END_STR>>
allow us to reach Eldeel<27>s room.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★The elevator isn<27>t working. Hopefully nothing has<<END_STR>>
happened to Eldeel. With the elevator non-functional,<<END_STR>>
we<27>re going to have to climb the tower on foot.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We reached Eldeel<27>s room, which looks the same as when<<END_STR>>
I visited it in my memories, but he<27>s nowhere to be seen.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We finally met Eldeel, but during our conversation his<<END_STR>>
dominant <27>personality<27> changed. Even his appearance<<END_STR>>
changed! He managed to get it under control, but this<<END_STR>>
appears to be the <27>illness<27> Leeza was trying to hide from<<END_STR>>
everyone. Perhaps we should return another day.<<END_STR>>
★Suddenly, we smelled smoke. It seems Highland is being<<END_STR>>
raided -- we have to hurry back!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Damage was visible all over the town. We should hurry to<<END_STR>>
Calilica<27>s home and make sure everyone is safe.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We were surrounded by masked soldiers in front of the<<END_STR>>
cathedral. We tried to fight them off, but they were too<<END_STR>>
strong.<<END_STR>>
★Gruda of the Romun Army appeared and revealed that he had<<END_STR>>
orchestrated the attack on Highland. The Sanctuary of<<END_STR>>
Storms<27> thunderstorms were silenced by Gadis and Bami,<<END_STR>>
who appeared before us again. The entirety of their actions<<END_STR>>
when we encountered them last were on Gruda<27>s orders.<<END_STR>>
★Furthermore, one of the masked soldiers with them was<<END_STR>>
revealed to be Remnos, who claimed that unlike when we<<END_STR>>
last met, he is now opposing us of his own free will.<<END_STR>>
Unable to resist, we were forced to let him get away.<<END_STR>>
★The Romun Army, under Gruda<27>s command, proceeded deeper<<END_STR>>
into the forest. They appear to be trying to obtain the<<END_STR>>
Mask of the Sun, a relic of the Kingdom of Celceta which<<END_STR>>
collapsed hundreds of years ago.<<END_STR>>
★During the confusion, Eldeel and Leeza disappeared.<<END_STR>>
Where could they be?<<END_STR>>
★Governor General Griselda arrived in Highland and<<END_STR>>
announced that the Celcetan Army would be responsible for<<END_STR>>
guarding the town. She informed us that Gruda had betrayed<<END_STR>>
Romn, and Commander Leo and his men were sent to pursue.<<END_STR>>
★We agreed to the mayor<27>s suggestion to go deeper into the<<END_STR>>
Great Forest, into the area known as the <27>Ashen Forest.<27><<END_STR>>
We were told there is a village in that area, and its<<END_STR>>
inhabitants may know something about the Mask of the Sun<<END_STR>>
and Eldeel<27>s condition.<<END_STR>>
★We left Highland for the Ashen Forest, accompanied by<<END_STR>>
Calilica (who<27>s really worried about Eldeel and Leeza).<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We set up camp in Table Mountain, where I remembered<<END_STR>>
being knocked into a waterfall by the black-winged Eldeel.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_470>>Danan Village<<SPASE>>Danan Village
<<START>>★We discovered the village Mayor Aaron described in the<<END_STR>>
Subterranean Forest. Let<27>s check it out.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We were welcomed by a warrior named Frieda, who acts<<END_STR>>
as if she knows me. Furthermore, we found out that Duren<<END_STR>>
is originally from this village!<<END_STR>>
★It seems the inhabitants of this village are the <<END_STR>>
descendants of great sinners, and Duren and Frieda are<<END_STR>>
somehow involved. The elder will explain in more detail--<<END_STR>>
those two are taking the rest of us to meet with him.<<END_STR>>
His house is in front of the central tower.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★The village elder, Vanjo, detailed a brief history of<<END_STR>>
the village to us. It seems their ancestors sinned by<<END_STR>>
betraying the gods, resulting in the destruction of a<<END_STR>>
great civilization. However, they were forgiven by Eldeel,<<END_STR>>
who brought them here from their original home far away.<<END_STR>>
★Eldeel<27>s other personality has come to the surface before,<<END_STR>>
and it led to him destroying the ancient Kingdom of Celceta.<<END_STR>>
His dark behavior now is similar to his behavior at that time.<<END_STR>>
Because of this, Vanjo had asked Duren to keep an eye on<<END_STR>>
me when I visited the tower. <<END_STR>>
★After talking with Vanjo, he showed us to a small shrine<<END_STR>>
in the village where the Mask of the Sun is being kept.<<END_STR>>
Frieda was the one who had it taken from my grave, and<<END_STR>>
it was Duren who rescued me when I fell from the waterfall.<<END_STR>>
★The Mask of the Sun has the unique ability to read<<END_STR>>
the <27>Akashic Records,<27> the blueprints of the world, and<<END_STR>>
Eldeel uses these Akashic Records to grant <27>wisdom<27> to<<END_STR>>
others. The Akashic Records are kept deeper in the Great<<END_STR>>
Forest, and obtaining them seems likely to be Gruda<27>s<<END_STR>>
ultimate goal.<<END_STR>>
★Leeza surprised us and began trying to use a<<END_STR>>
Galbalan named Sol to destroy the barrier surrounding<<END_STR>>
the Mask of the Sun in an effort to obtain it.<<END_STR>>
★We discovered that Sol-Galba is immune to conventional<<END_STR>>
weapons and were unable to stop it from destroying the<<END_STR>>
barrier, but just as Leeza was about to claim the Mask of<<END_STR>>
the Sun, Gruda appeared and took it for himself.<<END_STR>>
★Gruda manipulated her to obtain the Mask, and<<END_STR>>
she fell right into his trap.<<END_STR>>
★It was revealed that Gruda is originally from Danan as<<END_STR>>
well, and he announced that he would be taking the cursed<<END_STR>>
name of the tribe<27>s ancestors, the Darklings. He then<<END_STR>>
escaped, denying us any opportunity to stop him by using<<END_STR>>
villagers as hostages.<<END_STR>>
★The entirety of the Akashic Records which Gruda seeks<<END_STR>>
are kept beyond the Subterranean Forest in Elduke, the<<END_STR>>
former capital of the Kingdom of Celceta. This is where<<END_STR>>
Eldeel is headed as well.<<END_STR>>
★Leeza left for Elduke on Sol-Galba. Frieda has agreed<<END_STR>>
to guide us on foot, and we should be leaving as well.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_523>>Ruined Kingdom<<SPASE>>Ruined Kingdom
<<START>>★We met Commander Leo, Sancho and Panza in the Ashen <<END_STR>>
Forest, and they agreed to allow us to go on ahead of <<END_STR>>
them. With Frieda<27>s help, we should be able to get through<<END_STR>>
the paths that are blocked by poisonous gases.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We set up camp in the Ashen Forest, and I remembered <<END_STR>>
Eldeel confessing his worries to me.<<END_STR>>
★The path ahead is filled with strange spores. We<27>ll have<<END_STR>>
to proceed cautiously.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We left the Forest of Spores and emerged on the <<END_STR>>
Battlefield of Colonia. We<27>re almost at Elduke now!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We finally reached Elduke. Unfortunately, the area is<<END_STR>>
already occupied by the Masked Division. We need to find<<END_STR>>
a way to get to the Temple of the Sun, but we<27>ll have to<<END_STR>>
be careful we<27>re not spotted.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We saw Remnos near the temple. He left the area,<<END_STR>>
taking most of the soldiers with him. Now<27>s our chance to<<END_STR>>
sneak in and investigate!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We reached the temple, but were unable to open the door.<<END_STR>>
As we were pondering how to get inside, Gruda, Bami and<<END_STR>>
Gadis appeared-- and even worse, black-winged Eldeel was<<END_STR>>
with them.<<END_STR>>
★Black-winged Eldeel has been periodically giving Gruda<<END_STR>>
and his allies all kinds of secret information. Using the<<END_STR>>
Mask of the Sun as a key, they entered the Temple of the<<END_STR>>
Sun.<<END_STR>>
★We tried to pursue them, but the door had already firmly<<END_STR>>
closed behind them. Isn<27>t there any other way to enter the<<END_STR>>
Temple of the Sun? We<27>ll have to inspect the surrounding<<END_STR>>
area and see if we can find anything.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★As we walked down the steps, Karna sensed something<<END_STR>>
strange nearby. We should probably investigate.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We witnessed an odd creature entering a hole. Let<27>s<<END_STR>>
follow it!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We found ourselves inside a Roda Tree, and heard a<<END_STR>>
peculiar voice calling us from farther in.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★According to Frieda, the creatures inside here are sacred<<END_STR>>
beasts called <27>Roos.<27> Why does that name sound familiar?<<END_STR>>
Spardas can be found near Elduke as well. But for now,<<END_STR>>
we really need to locate the source of that voice.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Deep within the Roos<27> Nest, we found the Grand Roo,<<END_STR>>
capable of human speech. It seems he can also talk to<<END_STR>>
the Roda Tree, and it was the Roda Tree that asked him<<END_STR>>
to lead us here.<<END_STR>>
★There is another mask of importance, the Mask of the Moon,<<END_STR>>
which serves as a twin to the Mask of the Sun. The ancient<<END_STR>>
ruler of the Kingdom of Celceta, King Lefance, used the<<END_STR>>
Mask of the Moon to pacify the black-winged Eldeel.<<END_STR>>
★If we can obtain the Mask of the Moon, we should be able<<END_STR>>
to use it to enter the Temple of the Sun. Even better, we<<END_STR>>
can then use it to return Eldeel to normal. While the Roda<<END_STR>>
Tree doesn<27>t know all the details, it suggested we should<<END_STR>>
be able to learn more from King Lefance<27>s memories.<<END_STR>>
★While the Mask of the Moon itself was lost a long time<<END_STR>>
ago, the Roda Tree senses something similar in Mt. Vesuvio<<END_STR>>
and the ruins on Lake Tolmes, both near Elduke. We can<<END_STR>>
reach these locations by leaving the temple grounds via the<<END_STR>>
eastern exit.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_584>>Mask of the Moon<<SPASE>>Mask of the Moon: Lake Tolmes
<<START>>★We reached the Lake Tolmes Ruins. Let<27>s start looking for<<END_STR>>
clues right away.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★During our exploration, we found one of Lefance<27>s<<END_STR>>
memories.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★What a dreadful stench! It seems to be coming from<<END_STR>>
farther inside the ruins...<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★According to Frieda, all of the water in the Primeval<<END_STR>>
Lands comes from here, and is purified by the Spardas.<<END_STR>>
This is a role given to them by Eldeel.<<END_STR>>
We were all surprised to learn that what we thought was<<END_STR>>
poison was actually essential to the natural environment<<END_STR>>
of the forest, but Ozma was the most shocked of us all.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We found another of Lefance<27>s memories, which revealed<<END_STR>>
the truth about the Spardas and Ozma<27>s tribe.<<END_STR>>
★Before we could explore any farther, Gadis showed up<<END_STR>>
and used the power of one of Gruda<27>s masks to transform<<END_STR>>
into a monster. It was a difficult battle, but we emerged<<END_STR>>
victorious. Regrettably, Gadis<27> body and spirit<<END_STR>>
disintegrated, unable to withstand the power of the mask.<<END_STR>>
★Although Ozma had accomplished what he set out to do by<<END_STR>>
learning the truth of the Spardas, he agreed to continue<<END_STR>>
lending us his assistance.<<END_STR>>
★There appears to be an altar of some kind. We should<<END_STR>>
investigate it more closely.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We obtained part of a mask, but it doesn<27>t appear to have<<END_STR>>
any power left within it. Could this be part of the Mask<<END_STR>>
of the Moon?<<END_STR>>
★Now that we<27>ve finished exploring the ruins on Lake<<END_STR>>
Tolmes, we should investigate the other location the Grand<<END_STR>>
Roo mentioned: Mt. Vesuvio.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We now have our second mask fragment. If both are held<<END_STR>>
together, they form a complete mask, but nothing happens.<<END_STR>>
Perhaps Remnos might know something? We should hurry<<END_STR>>
back to Elduke.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_621>>Mask of the Moon<<SPASE>>Mask of the Moon: Mt. Vesvio
<<START>>★We reached the base of Mt. Vesuvio. As the volcano on the<<END_STR>>
west side is currently inaccessible, we decided to climb<<END_STR>>
the snowy mountain on the eastern side.<<END_STR>>
★While we were climbing the mountain, Commander Leo showed<<END_STR>>
up and informed us that Masked Division soldiers are in the<<END_STR>>
area. He also said that he caught sight of Remnos here too.<<END_STR>>
If the Masked Division are looking for the Mask of the<<END_STR>>
Moon as well, then we really need to hurry!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★During our expedition, we found another of Lefance<27>s<<END_STR>>
memories.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We encountered Remnos as we were climbing the mountain<<END_STR>>
and discovered that all of his actions since he broke free<<END_STR>>
from Bami<27>s control were a ruse so he could spy on Gruda.<<END_STR>>
He hadn<27>t recovered the Mask of the Moon, as he intended<<END_STR>>
for us to take it-- but this unfortunately led Bami to<<END_STR>>
learn the truth, and Remnos was placed under a powerful<<END_STR>>
curse that threatens to kill him.<<END_STR>>
★After we repelled a group of soldiers from the Masked<<END_STR>>
Division, Commander Leo arrived. Sadly, the only way<<END_STR>>
to free Remnos from Bami<27>s curse is to defeat her in<<END_STR>>
battle. Remnos will be safe with Commander Leo, so we<<END_STR>>
should hurry after Bami.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We caught up with Bami. She transformed into a monster<<END_STR>>
using one of Gruda<27>s masks and attacked us.<<END_STR>>
★It was a difficult battle, but we emerged victorious.<<END_STR>>
Remnos should be free from the curse now.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We found another of Lefance<27>s memories, and discovered<<END_STR>>
that the Mask of the Moon was created by Eldeel himself.<<END_STR>>
We still don<27>t know why he created it, however.<<END_STR>>
Let<27>s check out the altar farther inside.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We obtained part of a mask, but it doesn<27>t appear to have<<END_STR>>
any power left in it. Could this be one piece of the Mask<<END_STR>>
of the Moon?<<END_STR>>
★Now that we<27>ve finished exploring Mt. Vesuvio, we should<<END_STR>>
investigate the other location the Grand Roo mentioned:<<END_STR>>
the ruins on Lake Tolmes.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We now have our second mask fragment. If both are held<<END_STR>>
together, they form a complete mask, but nothing happens.<<END_STR>>
Perhaps Remnos might know something? We should hurry<<END_STR>>
back to Elduke.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_664>>Repairing the Mask<<SPASE>>Repairing the Mask
<<START>>★We returned to the Roos<27> Nest and found Remnos had been<<END_STR>>
freed from Bami<27>s curse. With Remnos safe, Karna<27>s<<END_STR>>
objective has been achieved, but she agreed to accompany<<END_STR>>
us till the bitter end to protect Celceta.<<END_STR>>
★The two halves of the Mask of the Moon have completely<<END_STR>>
lost their power. Remnos suggested that we might be able<<END_STR>>
to repair them in an artifact laboratory near here. We<<END_STR>>
should see if the Roda Tree or Grand Roo know anything.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★The artifact laboratory Remnos mentioned is supposedly<<END_STR>>
to the north of Colonia Battlefield. Furthermore, Leeza<<END_STR>>
seems to be there as well.<<END_STR>>
★The laboratory is filled with <27>living weapons<27> that can<27>t<<END_STR>>
be defeated through conventional means. However, the Roda<<END_STR>>
Tree presented us with the <27>Artifact Sword Emeraude,<27><<END_STR>>
which should be capable of felling them successfully.<<END_STR>>
★Remnos begrudgingly agreed to stay in the Roos<27> Nest, <<END_STR>>
leaving us to head north of the battlefield to the<<END_STR>>
laboratory.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★The door to the laboratory is guarded by one of the<<END_STR>>
living weapons the Roda Tree mentioned. If we can stop its<<END_STR>>
movements, I can finish it off with Emeraude!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Thanks to the power of the Artifact Sword, we were able<<END_STR>>
to defeat the living weapon. This is definitely the<<END_STR>>
artifact laboratory we were looking for. Nina returned<<END_STR>>
and informed us that Leeza is inside. We need to proceed<<END_STR>>
with the utmost caution!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We heard a girl<27>s scream from farther inside the<<END_STR>>
laboratory. Could it have been Leeza?!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We found Leeza. She was with Sol-Galba, but he<27>d gone<<END_STR>>
berserk. According to Leeza, Sol-Galba suddenly stopped <<END_STR>>
listening to her instructions as they approached Elduke.<<END_STR>>
He also gained the ability to speak?! Sol-Galba flew<<END_STR>>
to the other side of the laboratory.<<END_STR>>
★Leeza has no more of an idea as to why Sol-Galba is<<END_STR>>
behaving strangely than we do. We should pursue it,<<END_STR>>
but will need to protect her as well.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We discovered Sol-Galba on the opposite side of the <<END_STR>>
laboratory.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Sol-Galba appears to have lost all control of its<<END_STR>>
actions. It<27>s too dangerous to leave it like this. We<27>re<<END_STR>>
going to have to stop it!<<END_STR>>
★After successfully subduing Sol-Galba, something emerged<<END_STR>>
from inside of it. It was the soul of King Lefance, ruler<<END_STR>>
of the lost Celcetan Kingdom!<<END_STR>>
★He explained that after his soul was released from its<<END_STR>>
resting place, it lost its self-restraint and was drawn to his <<END_STR>>
descendant, Leeza. As a result, it wound up possessing<<END_STR>>
the body of Sol-Galba.<<END_STR>>
★According to King Lefance, the fact that his soul was <<END_STR>>
released means that the evil soul of Eldeel has also been<<END_STR>>
released, as he was the one responsible for sealing it <<END_STR>>
away. There<27>s no time to waste: we have to stop Eldeel<<END_STR>>
and Gruda before it<27>s too late!<<END_STR>>
★Using the altar in the laboratory, we were able to<<END_STR>>
repair the Mask of the Moon by replenishing its magic<<END_STR>>
power. We should now be able to enter the temple.<<END_STR>>
★King Lefance left for Elduke ahead of us, saying that he<<END_STR>>
will explain what we have to do in more detail later. Leeza<<END_STR>>
also departed on Sol-Galba, and we should be on our way<<END_STR>>
too.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_727>>Temple of the Sun<<SPASE>>Temple of the Sun
<<START>>★We reunited with Nina, who had been scouting the area<<END_STR>>
around Elduke. Not long after Bami was defeated, the<<END_STR>>
Masked Division returned to their senses. We should hurry<<END_STR>>
into the Temple of the Sun.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★King Lefance and Leeza were waiting for us at the<<END_STR>>
Temple of the Sun. We now know the Mask of the Moon has <<END_STR>>
the ability to seal away the black-winged Eldeel. To do<<END_STR>>
this, however, we will need to put the mask on him, and<<END_STR>>
its effects are only temporary.<<END_STR>>
★If we can speak with Eldeel, we might be able to find a<<END_STR>>
more permanent solution. He<27>ll be a challenging opponent,<<END_STR>>
but we can<27>t turn back now. Leeza is depending on us!<<END_STR>>
★The Mask of the Moon was entrusted to me. I put it on and<<END_STR>>
opened the temple door. The showdown with Eldeel awaits;<<END_STR>>
we should enter as soon as we<27>re ready.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★The audience chamber was empty. It seems Eldeel is in the<<END_STR>>
room where the Akashic Records are kept. We need to hurry!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We confronted black-winged Eldeel in front of the Akashic<<END_STR>>
Records. He plans to bring about natural disasters across <<END_STR>>
the whole of the Europan continent, convinced that this is<<END_STR>>
the proper use of a god<27>s power. I<27>m not going to let that<<END_STR>>
happen!<<END_STR>>
★It was a difficult battle, but we were able to subdue <<END_STR>>
Eldeel long enough to put the Mask of the Moon on him<<END_STR>>
and allow him to return to his original persona.<<END_STR>>
★The black-winged Eldeel, shockingly, is not a separate<<END_STR>>
entity, but rather another part of Eldeel himself, born<<END_STR>>
from his own second thoughts about gifting false <27>wisdom.<27><<END_STR>>
The black-winged Eldeel seeks to stimulate creativity<<END_STR>>
instead by imposing ordeals upon humanity.<<END_STR>>
★During our talk with Eldeel, Gruda appeared and declared<<END_STR>>
that Eldeel was an <27>incomplete<27> god, proclaiming that<<END_STR>>
only he could give humanity a worthy ordeal. He then<<END_STR>>
disappeared, taking the Mask of the Sun (which he had<<END_STR>>
stolen from Eldeel) with him.<<END_STR>>
★Eldeel believes Gruda has entered Iris, the <27>world<27> in<<END_STR>>
which all records of existence are stored, and intends to<<END_STR>>
bring about global calamity by interfering with these<<END_STR>>
records.<<END_STR>>
★Eldeel opened the door to Iris using the power of the<<END_STR>>
Mask of the Moon. We need to hurry and stop Gruda<<END_STR>>
before the black-winged Eldeel resurfaces!<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_773>>Pursuing Gruda<<SPASE>>Pursuing Gruda
<<START>>★We successfully entered Iris. King Lefance informed us<<END_STR>>
that it is possible to interfere with the world<27>s records<<END_STR>>
by using a device on the top floor, in the Central Area.<<END_STR>>
That<27>s where we<27>re sure to find Gruda.<<END_STR>>
★In order to access the Central Area, we<27>ll need to<<END_STR>>
defeat the guardians of the three areas ahead of us--<<END_STR>>
Bronze, Silver and Gold. We<27>ll have to be quick about it,<<END_STR>>
too, as time is running out!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We defeated the guardian of the Bronze Area.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We defeated the guardian of the Silver Area.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We defeated the guardian of the Gold Area.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Now that we<27>ve defeated all three guardians, we should<<END_STR>>
be able to access the Central Area and confront Gruda.<<END_STR>>
We should go there as soon as we<27>re ready.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★At last, we<27>ve entered the Central Area. The device to<<END_STR>>
interfere with the Akashic Records should be just a little<<END_STR>>
farther in. There<27>s no time to lose!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★We finally found Gruda.<<END_STR>>
★Gruda revealed that his objective is to test humanity<<END_STR>>
and have us prove our right to exist by showing our<<END_STR>>
potential. This is the basic theology behind his new <<END_STR>>
generation of <27>Darklings.<27><<END_STR>>
★Gruda successfully copied the whole of the Akashic<<END_STR>>
Records into himself, accomplishing through force of will<<END_STR>>
alone a task that it<27>s said not even a god could manage.<<END_STR>>
This has made him into a giant, and if we don<27>t stop him,<<END_STR>>
he<27>ll overwrite the whole world. We cannot accept defeat!<<END_STR>>
★By emerging victorious at the end of a tough battle, we<<END_STR>>
overcame Gruda<27>s trial. His presence can no longer be felt<<END_STR>>
anywhere in the vicinity.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★As we claimed the Mask of the Sun, the area began shaking<<END_STR>>
violently. What<27>s happening?! We have to hurry back to the<<END_STR>>
Temple of the Sun. Back to Eldeel.<<END_STR>>
<<HENDER_END>>
<<HENDER_809>>The Final Battle<<SPASE>>The Final Battle: Celceta<27>s Fate
<<START>>★We returned to the Temple of the Sun and were filled in<<END_STR>>
on the situation by Eldeel. Now, as a result of<<END_STR>>
Gruda<27>s actions, contradictions and inconsistencies have<<END_STR>>
appeared in the Akashic Records. If something isn<27>t<<END_STR>>
done to fix them, a calamity will befall the entire world,<<END_STR>>
with Celceta at its center.<<END_STR>>
★Eldeel says that it<27>s too late for him to try and repair<<END_STR>>
Iris on his own. Our only option is to destroy the Mask<<END_STR>>
of the Sun itself. If the mask is destroyed, the Akashic<<END_STR>>
Records will become non-functional.<<END_STR>>
★The only place where the mask can be destroyed is the<<END_STR>>
volcanic crater of Mt. Vesuvio. With my companions at my<<END_STR>>
side, I<27>m sure we can see this through to the end.<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★As we were about to leave the audience chamber, we were<<END_STR>>
attacked by a number of strange shadows, which must have <<END_STR>>
been created by distortions in the Akashic Records. It<27>s<<END_STR>>
probable they<27>re appearing elsewhere in Celceta as well.<<END_STR>>
★Ozma and Karna decided to stay in the Temple of the Sun<<END_STR>>
to protect Eldeel. He should be safe with them, while the<<END_STR>>
rest of us continue to Mt. Vesuvio.<<END_STR>>
★We were surrounded by shadows, which appear to be drawn<<END_STR>>
to the Mask of the Sun, when Remnos, Commander Leo, Sancho<<END_STR>>
and Panza came to our aid. Thanks to their help, we were<<END_STR>>
able to move on.<<END_STR>>
★The shadows continue to pursue us. Leeza arrived on Sol-<<END_STR>>
Galba to help us, and after leaving Calilica behind to<<END_STR>>
aid her in battle, we continued onward to the mountain.<<END_STR>>
★As we began to climb Mt. Vesuvio, we encountered a new<<END_STR>>
kind of shadow which took the form of Gruda. I suspect<<END_STR>>
these shadows are a result of his crazed devotion taking<<END_STR>>
form through the Akashic Records<27> power. Nonetheless, with<<END_STR>>
Duren and Frieda<27>s help, I must keep climbing!<<END_STR>>
<<START>>★Just as we were about to reach the peak of Mt. Vesuvio,<<END_STR>>
a large group of shadow Grudas appeared. Duren and Frieda<<END_STR>>
stayed behind to deal with them, leaving me to make the<<END_STR>>
final push alone.<<END_STR>>
★I reached the crater and came face to face with Gruda<27>s<<END_STR>>
obsession in shadow form-- a foe born from multiple shadows<<END_STR>>
converging into one. It<27>s time to finish this!<<END_STR>>
★After a hard-fought duel, I defeated phantom Gruda and<<END_STR>>
finally reached the crater. I couldn<27>t have come this far<<END_STR>>
without the efforts of my companions. All that remains is <<END_STR>>
to throw the Mask of the Sun into the volcano and leave<<END_STR>>
the rest to Celceta itself...<<END_STR>>
