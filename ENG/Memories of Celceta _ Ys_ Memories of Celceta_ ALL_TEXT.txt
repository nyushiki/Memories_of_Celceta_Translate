#00100FRight, then, it's almost time for us to get<<CRLF>>started exploring the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
#00105FBefore that, though...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou've had a bit of a warm-up at the<<CRLF>>mines, but the monsters in the Great Forest<<CRLF>>are on a different level altogether.
#00100FSo let me give you a few pointers on<<CRLF>>combat technique.<<CRLF>>
#00105FI guess that's about everything.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAll that's left is for you to try them out<<CRLF>>in an actual battle!<<CRLF>>
<< mp1102.JSON_TEXT 21 >>
#4CLangritz was defeated!
#4CThe female fabros is standing calmly.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105F(Well, we managed to get behind it<<CRLF>>without it noticing us...)<<CRLF>>
#00100F(Let's get milking before it bolts away!)<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FPerfect!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FMan, she's a jittery one...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FTook her long enough to notice us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe female fabros ran away.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FBah, looks like it spotted us.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FGuess we need to be really careful to<<CRLF>>stay out of its line of sight.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSuppose we'll just have to wait for it to<<CRLF>>come back and try again.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAll right, looks like it's back.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FNow, Mucho said female fabroses are<<CRLF>>really skittish.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo we need to approach it from behind<<CRLF>>veeeeery carefully this time.<<CRLF>>
#00111FWhew... We haven't even traveled that<<CRLF>>far and I'm already tired!<<CRLF>>
#00101FHere's a tip, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWhen you feel tired, it's important to<<CRLF>>stop moving and rest for a while. If you<<CRLF>>do that, you'll feel better in no time!
#00100FOh, and with two of us fighting, working<<CRLF>>together's really important, too.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo feel free to give me orders if you<<CRLF>>need to.<<CRLF>>
#00105FThat's about all I've got for the moment.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FCome on, Adol, let's keep up the pace!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp1103.JSON_TEXT 35 >>
#00101FWeird... I could sense beasts all around<<CRLF>>us before, but now it's like they're all<<CRLF>>gone.
#00109FWait, is that...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah, sure enough! I heard about this<<CRLF>>from a colleague of mine.<<CRLF>>
#00100FHe said that there are places in the Great<<CRLF>>Forest where spirit tree saplings grow, and<<CRLF>>monsters will never approach them.
What's a spirit tree?
I've heard that too, I think...
#00105FWell, supposedly some god who lived in<<CRLF>>this area planted them, or so the story<<CRLF>>goes.
#00105FI figured it was all a load of nonsense,<<CRLF>>but...<<CRLF>>
#00109FW-wait, does that mean your memory...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00001F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol felt as though he were about to remember something, but try<<CRLF>>as he might, it just wouldn't come to him.<<CRLF>>
#00111FDamn.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, if nothing else, this seems like an<<CRLF>>ideal place to take a breather.<<CRLF>>
#00100FGive me a hand setting this up, would<<CRLF>>you?<<CRLF>>
#00103FVoila! How's that? Not bad, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FWe should probably set up a tent every<<CRLF>>time we find a sapling. These can be our<<CRLF>>bases of operations...or something.
#00100FThe sun's been down for a while, so<<CRLF>>what say you to resting here for the<<CRLF>>night?
#4CThat night...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CEnveloped in the clear air of the forest and the fragrance of the<<CRLF>>spirit tree, Adol felt his body drift into a deep, relaxing slumber...<<CRLF>>
#4COne of the memories sealed in the back of Adol's mind was<<CRLF>>restored!<<CRLF>>
#00103FAaah...that was a great night's sleep.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...But only for me, looks like! You're<<CRLF>>lookin' pretty groggy, yourself. You have<<CRLF>>a nightmare?
#4CAdol described the memory he'd regained.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FA tower? Huh...interesting.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FI've never heard of there being one out in<<CRLF>>the forest, but I guess there must be if<<CRLF>>you remember it that distinctly.
#00100FEither way, if resting near saplings helps<<CRLF>>to get your memories back, we should<<CRLF>>do it every time we stumble across one.
#4CMemory fragments in the surrounding area are\nnow visible on the map.

Ooh, a tent!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Score! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Being able to take advantage of other people's<<CRLF>>hard work is our reward for showing up late.<<CRLF>>
The winner is always the one who goes last!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Whew, can't believe how far I've come.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Casnan is almost in sight...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp1104.JSON_TEXT 66 >>
I can't even imagine how it must feel for one<<CRLF>>of your comrades to die in battle.<<CRLF>>
...I suppose in my case, those comrades would<<CRLF>>be Sancho and Panza.<<CRLF>>
Just imagining that... No, I can't bear to think<<CRLF>>about it!<<CRLF>>
Daniel seems even more homesick than usual<<CRLF>>lately.<<CRLF>>
I'm from Celceta, so I can't really relate...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...But watching him suffer definitely makes me<<CRLF>>feel bad for him.<<CRLF>>
Have you heard the latest rumor? Apparently<<CRLF>>there's been a utopia found on the other side<<CRLF>>of the river!
I'm a Romun soldier, but I haven't heard a thing<<CRLF>>about it. It's really frustrating to be kept out<<CRLF>>of the loop, you know?
It'd be amazing if it were true. I wish I could<<CRLF>>find out for sure!<<CRLF>>
I wonder if Sancho and Panza know anything.<<CRLF>>I should ask them.<<CRLF>>
I wonder if Sancho and Panza know anything<<CRLF>>about the utopia on the other side of the<<CRLF>>river. I should ask them!
But it doesn't seem like those two are coming<<CRLF>>back here anytime soon...<<CRLF>>
I wonder what the Romun Army soldiers who<<CRLF>>entered the Great Forest are doing right now...<<CRLF>>
I doubt they've all been wiped out, but<<CRLF>>there could've been some pretty significant<<CRLF>>casualties.
It might've been a bit chaotic here yesterday,<<CRLF>>but it was a relief to see Sancho and Panza are<<CRLF>>still alive and well.
Commander Leo seemed to be doing fine, too...<<CRLF>>Guess there's no reason to worry about them.<<CRLF>>Everybody's still in tip-top shape!
Most of the Romun Army soldiers seem to be an<<CRLF>>inflexible bunch, just like Daniel.<<CRLF>>
I guess that's just how soldiers wind up when<<CRLF>>military regulations are strict.<<CRLF>>
Most of the Romun Army soldiers seem to be an<<CRLF>>inflexible bunch.<<CRLF>>
I guess that's just how soldiers wind up when<<CRLF>>military regulations are strict.<<CRLF>>
Those two with Commander Leo, Sancho and<<CRLF>>Panza, were in the same year as me.<<CRLF>>
They actually didn't apply to join the<<CRLF>>expedition into the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
They just kinda caught Commander Leo's eye one<<CRLF>>day, and before they knew it, they were up the<<CRLF>>trees without a paddle! Or something like that.
I wonder if they're doing okay out there...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if Sancho and Panza are doing okay<<CRLF>>out there...<<CRLF>>
All I can picture in the back of my mind is the<<CRLF>>two of them getting chewed out by Commander<<CRLF>>Leo!
Oh, you must be Adol, who took care of the<<CRLF>>incident at the mine yesterday. That red hair<<CRLF>>is a dead giveaway.
...Actually, haven't I seen you passing through<<CRLF>>here once before?<<CRLF>>
Yeah, I'm sure I have! We don't get enough<<CRLF>>visitors for me to forget a face too easily,<<CRLF>>much less one topped off with hair like that.
And you've gone out into the Great Forest, too,<<CRLF>>if I'm not mistaken. So you know better than<<CRLF>>most just how dangerous that place is.
...You've got some guts to want to go back for<<CRLF>>more, I'll give you that!<<CRLF>>
It doesn't seem like you're doing it purely for<<CRLF>>the reward money, either.<<CRLF>>
Well, best of luck to you. You're gonna need it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Call it a hunch, but it doesn't seem to me like<<CRLF>>you're charting the forest purely for the reward<<CRLF>>money.
Well, best of luck to you. You're gonna need it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My comrades back in Romn were sent to Afroca,<<CRLF>>and many of them lost their lives in battle.<<CRLF>>
Compared to them, I'm incredibly blessed.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And yet, there's a part of me that can't help<<CRLF>>but envy them sometimes.<<CRLF>>
Risking your life fighting for your country is<<CRLF>>a scary thing, but it's also a really honorable<<CRLF>>way to go.
Risking your life fighting for your country is<<CRLF>>a scary thing, but it's also a really honorable<<CRLF>>way to go.
Compared to those who do that, I...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...I wonder if my mother is doing all right back<<CRLF>>home.<<CRLF>>
I should write to her.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder why people can't be truly free...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The clouds above float across the sky so<<CRLF>>freely, and yet we're locked into this endless<<CRLF>>cycle of rules and riots.
Today, the sky is piercingly blue...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...I wonder if the sky back home is the same<<CRLF>>shade.<<CRLF>>
I want to go back home. But the Romun Army's<<CRLF>>missions are extremely hard work, so...I kinda<<CRLF>>don't, too.
I know that makes me sound incredibly lazy,<<CRLF>>but it's the truth.<<CRLF>>
There doesn't seem to be anyone I know among<<CRLF>>the Romun Army soldiers they sent over.<<CRLF>>
I wonder what my comrades back home would<<CRLF>>think if they saw me standing around in a remote<<CRLF>>region like this.
I wish I were invisible.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Then no one would notice me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'd rather be invisible than get laughed at<<CRLF>>by my comrades.<<CRLF>>
At least then, no one would notice me...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's a good feeling to have friends and<<CRLF>>companions who care about you.<<CRLF>>
I had fellow soldiers whom I could call<<CRLF>>comrades back in Romn...but I wonder if<<CRLF>>they even remember me anymore.
It's been five years since I took up this post.<<CRLF>>I'm a long way from home...<<CRLF>>
And even after all this time, I still can't get<<CRLF>>used to it.<<CRLF>>
Commander Leo is as energetic as ever.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The two soldiers with him seem to have been<<CRLF>>conscripted from around here.<<CRLF>>

#4CA couple of miners are talking nearby.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Competitive Miner
Hey, you heard the latest news? Seems they<<CRLF>>found another gold vein.<<CRLF>>
Calm Miner
Yeah, I heard the head miner went to check it<<CRLF>>out a while ago.<<CRLF>>
Competitive Miner
Way I hear it, there are veins all the way into<<CRLF>>the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
Calm Miner
Hah, this gold rush business really never lets<<CRLF>>up, does it?<<CRLF>>
Still, are they seriously planning to start<<CRLF>>messing around in the forest?<<CRLF>>
Competitive Miner
Don't even joke about that!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Going near that place isn't worth all the money<<CRLF>>in the world. Can't spend it if you're dead,<<CRLF>>after all!
Knowledgeable Man
Can't believe it's been five years since Celceta<<CRLF>>came under Romun control...<<CRLF>>
And this city has never been more active.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Bold Merchant
Hmph. A happy accident. The Romuns don't<<CRLF>>give a damn about us.<<CRLF>>
Until they struck gold, they couldn't even be<<CRLF>>bothered servicing the roads around here!<<CRLF>>
Knowledgeable Man
Well, I hear there's going to be a new Governor<<CRLF>>General soon, for what it's worth.<<CRLF>>
Bold Merchant
Who cares? Nothing's gonna change.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
They just come over here, put all their effort<<CRLF>>into lining their own pockets, and then as soon<<CRLF>>as the money runs dry, the cycle starts over.
Knowledgeable Man
I suppose you're right. But...wait, hang on...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Knowledgeable Man
Looks like a Romun officer. And a pretty hot<<CRLF>>one, at that!<<CRLF>>
Bold Merchant
Hmph. I wish they'd at least end the war with<<CRLF>>Altago so I could do business in peace already.<<CRLF>>

Couldn't agree more there. Feels like they're<<CRLF>>just dragging their feet at this point.<<CRLF>>

#10102FWhat is taking so long? Hurry it up!<<CRLF>>Get the injured out of there!<<CRLF>>
Y-yes, ma'am!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FThe safety of the miners is our highest<<CRLF>>priority. Make certain all of them are<<CRLF>>accounted for!
U-understood!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FHuh. Who's that, now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That's Governor General Griselda. She just got<<CRLF>>here recently.<<CRLF>>
Seems Commander Leo's away on business<<CRLF>>today, so she was assigned here in his<<CRLF>>place.
I'm a little disappointed, to be honest. I came<<CRLF>>all this way to the mine so I could see the<<CRLF>>Romuns screw up, not do their jobs!
#00103FHaha. Guess you can't win 'em all!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FAre you the last?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
N-no... The head miner and a few others...got<<CRLF>>trapped in...the room...the monsters came out<<CRLF>>of...
P-please... Please, help them...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10101FCounting the head miner, how many<<CRLF>>are left?<<CRLF>>
Three...I think...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FUnderstood. You may rest now. We will<<CRLF>>see to it that the others are rescued.<<CRLF>>
#10102FYou two!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10102FThere are miners trapped inside who<<CRLF>>need our help. Make the necessary<<CRLF>>preparations and head in immediately!
#10509FEr...b-but...but we haven't received any<<CRLF>>orders from the Commander yet...<<CRLF>>
#10102FThis is an emergency, and I am in<<CRLF>>charge!<<CRLF>>
#10102FPrioritize the safe rescue of the miners<<CRLF>>above all else. There is no need to<<CRLF>>eliminate the monsters inside.
#10604FH-hey, Sancho? Who's higher rank, the<<CRLF>>Commander or the Governor General?<<CRLF>>
#10501FThe Governor General, of course! Idiot...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10102F#16SThere's no time to waste! Move it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sancho and Panza
#16SY-yes, ma'am!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The Governor General sure seems a hell of<<CRLF>>a lot more dependable than Commander Leo.<<CRLF>>
Shame you can't say the same about those<<CRLF>>soldiers...but let's wait and see, I guess.<<CRLF>>Maybe she can whip them into shape.
#4CA strange orb of light suddenly began shining nearby, yet no one<<CRLF>>else seemed able to see it but Adol.<<CRLF>>
#4CHe began to feel a light headache, and hear voices echoing inside<<CRLF>>his head...<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol's maximum HP increased by 10.
#4C'Sword...? Was I a swordsman?'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol felt an uncontrollable urge to get involved. It was simply too<<CRLF>>much to bear: he had to try to help resolve the situation.<<CRLF>>
#00109FWh-what's going on here?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here they come, here they come!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Good job! We heard all about you from the head<<CRLF>>miner, kid!<<CRLF>>
Thanks for helping my friends, big guy!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10103FExcellent work, gentlemen. So you are<<CRLF>>the red-haired youth noted in the report...<<CRLF>>
#10103FMy name is Griselda. I am the Governor<<CRLF>>General of Celceta. It is a pleasure to<<CRLF>>meet you.
I'm Adol Christin.
What's all this commotion?
#10103FAdol, you say? A fine name. Fitting for<<CRLF>>one as brave yet approachable as yourself.<<CRLF>>
#10103FThe people here heard that you rescued<<CRLF>>the miners, and have gathered to await<<CRLF>>your return.
#10105FI, too, would like to extend my deepest<<CRLF>>thanks for saving not only the miners,<<CRLF>>but some of our army's soldiers as well.
#10105FThere is more I wish to discuss with the<<CRLF>>two of you...<<CRLF>>
#10103FBut I'd prefer not to make this<<CRLF>>commotion any greater.<<CRLF>>
#10103FWould you mind accompanying me to<<CRLF>>my office?<<CRLF>>
Mustachioed Man
#10001FOh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FYou're the swordsman who took down<<CRLF>>that monster in the mine, aren't you?<<CRLF>>
Damned straight.
You've got the wrong person, bub.
#10000FHmph. I thought so.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10000FHow did I know, you ask? Because I'm a<<CRLF>>genius, of course!<<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SMy question was a rhetorical one.<<CRLF>>I know it was you.<<CRLF>>
#10002FFiery red hair is not exactly a common<<CRLF>>trait among the locals!<<CRLF>>
#10002F#0914VI am the great Leo, Commander of the<<CRLF>>Celcetan Army and the finest swordsman<<CRLF>>around!
#10002F#0916VDon't you start getting cocky just because<<CRLF>>you took down a little monster while<<CRLF>>I was away.
#10002F#0917VIf I'd been here, I would've defeated it in<<CRLF>>a tenth of the time, with such skill and<<CRLF>>grace you would've been left speechless!
#10003F#16S#0918VWahahahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...That Commander Leo is probably the<<CRLF>>most infamous man in Casnan. I'm...sure<<CRLF>>you can see why.
#00111FAmazing how quickly you got involved<<CRLF>>with some of the strangest, most<<CRLF>>influential folks around.
#4CExhausted, Adol and Duren made their way toward the bar.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FPretty amazing view, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThat's the Great Forest of Celceta,<<CRLF>>spreading out from one horizon to the<<CRLF>>other like a vast sea of trees.
Can't wait to start exploring it!
Vast is right. That's way too big!
#00111F*sigh* We'll see how long that enthu-<<CRLF>>siasm lasts...<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat's why the Romuns want a map of it,<<CRLF>>I guess.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThough apparently you've made it back<<CRLF>>alive from there once already.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAnyway, take a look to the northwest.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FCan't see it too well today because of the<<CRLF>>fog, but when it's nice out, there's a huge<<CRLF>>tree that towers over all the others.
#00100FI'd place it about...here on the map,<<CRLF>>roughly.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAlso, word around the Governor General's<<CRLF>>office is that the mouth of a large river's<<CRLF>>been found along the forest's coastline.
#00100FIf that's true, it'd mean a river cuts right<<CRLF>>through the middle of the forest.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWhich would put it about...here-ish?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FThese two bits of information are pretty<<CRLF>>much all we've got to go on for the<<CRLF>>moment.
#00100FMight as well check them both out. Up to<<CRLF>>you where we head first.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOnly things we can rely on at this point<<CRLF>>are our own two legs and a blank-ass<<CRLF>>map!
#00100FWe need to leave town through the north<<CRLF>>exit to get to the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
#00103FSo as soon as you're ready, let's get<<CRLF>>going.<<CRLF>>
#4C-Map Completion and Rewards-
#4CAs you explore the Great Forest, your map will\nbegin to fill in. The amount of ground that's\nbeen charted is shown as a percentage.
#4CThis percentage can be checked on the map\nitself, and a number of rewards are available\nto you based on this value.
#4CThere are ten reward tiers in total, which\ncan be attained by reporting your progress\nto Griselda in her office.
#4CIn addition to gold, some reward tiers also\ninclude valuable items. See if you can get\n100% map completion!
Man's Voice
#16SOut of the way, you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FUh-oh, here comes trouble.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MOh, it's you...uh, Adol, was it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI've just been ordered to start work on a map<<CRLF>>of the Great Forest by the Governor General<<CRLF>>herself!
#0MI hear you were told to do the same, but now<<CRLF>>that I'm on the case, you might as well just<<CRLF>>go home!
#0M#00924V#16SWahahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FDon't people say no one ever comes out<<CRLF>>of the Great Forest alive, Sancho?<<CRLF>>
#10604FAre we gonna be okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505FNot if we actually try to keep up with<<CRLF>>the Commander's madness.<<CRLF>>
#10500FIf we do what he says for a while,<<CRLF>>though, then we can just pretend to<<CRLF>>get lost and breathe easy!
#10002F#16SIMBECILES! You're pathetic!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FThat reward money will be ours! Then our<<CRLF>>praises will be sung throughout the land!<<CRLF>>
#10002FYou hear me? Come on! We're leaving!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sancho and Panza
#00941V#16SY-yes, sir!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FGuess we've got competition. Though I<<CRLF>>really don't think we have much to worry<<CRLF>>about...
#00100F...Ehhh, whatever. Let's just forget about<<CRLF>>that awkwardness and move on. We've got<<CRLF>>a map to make!
#00109F...City seems a bit livelier than before,<<CRLF>>don't you think?<<CRLF>>
#00109FThere are a whole lot more soldiers now,<<CRLF>>too...<<CRLF>>
They're all in your head.
It does seem that way.
#00100FNo, if I were dreaming people up, they<<CRLF>>sure wouldn't be soldiers!<<CRLF>>
#00100FYou need good instincts to be an<<CRLF>>information dealer, and mine aren't<<CRLF>>often wrong.
#00100FLeo was called back here too... Seems<<CRLF>>like something's going on.<<CRLF>>
#00103FWhatever! Let's go see the Governor<<CRLF>>General and figure out what's what.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWe need to give her our report, after all.<<CRLF>>And while we're there, we should try to<<CRLF>>figure out what all the hubbub's about.
#10200F...Are you by any chance Adol Christin?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who are you?
You've got the wrong person.
#10204FOh, please excuse my lack of manners.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10204FYou're just...a bit infamous around here,<<CRLF>>you see. I am most delighted for this<<CRLF>>opportunity.
#10203FHaha. You are a man of good humor,<<CRLF>>I see.<<CRLF>>
#10200FHair so vividly red is quite rare in Casnan,<<CRLF>>and does nothing to belie your identity.<<CRLF>>
#10206F#0877V#2MMy name is Gruda. It's a pleasure to<<CRLF>>finally meet you.<<CRLF>>
#10206F#0878V#2MI have heard all about you from the<<CRLF>>Governor General and Commander Leo.<<CRLF>>
#10206F#0879V#2MBetween the incident at the mine and<<CRLF>>your mapping of the forest, we seem to<<CRLF>>be quite indebted to you of late.
#10206F#0880V#2MWhile I am only a recent arrival, I look<<CRLF>>forward to seeing more of you in the<<CRLF>>future.
#00101FAre you with the Romun Army?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10203FHaha. I'm afraid so.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10200FI am in charge of unifying the Celcetan<<CRLF>>Army and Romun Army as Governor<<CRLF>>General Griselda's aide.
#10205FNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm afraid I<<CRLF>>cannot keep the Governor General waiting<<CRLF>>any longer.
#00109F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F*sigh* Looks like the Romuns are finally<<CRLF>>sending some half-decent soldiers over<<CRLF>>here.
#00111FGiven the riff-raff we've had so far, it's<<CRLF>>about damned time...<<CRLF>>
#00100FHmm... Looks like we're a bit too late to<<CRLF>>get much of anything else done today.<<CRLF>>
#00103FHow about we just go to the inn and<<CRLF>>have something to eat for now? We<<CRLF>>can plan our next move from there.
Are you serious?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm serious!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He ran through here in a total panic.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
His face was as red as a beetroot!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hahaha. That's not a very nice thing to say<<CRLF>>about beetroots!<<CRLF>>
H-hey, you want to go and take a look?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
At what? Whatever's going on over there, or<<CRLF>>Leo's face?<<CRLF>>
Both, of course!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Let's go, then! He was headed toward the Great<<CRLF>>Forest gate.<<CRLF>>
Are you serious?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm serious!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Let's go, then! He was headed toward the Great<<CRLF>>Forest gate.<<CRLF>>
#10603FThe wind must feel amazing up there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10603FBut how do you even climb that high?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505FSomeone said they saw her climbing up<<CRLF>>the outer wall.<<CRLF>>
#10603FReally? We're allowed to do that?! Wow,<<CRLF>>I've totally gotta try it!<<CRLF>>
#10505FIdiot! There's no way you'd be able to<<CRLF>>make it without falling.<<CRLF>>
#10501FThat must be...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16SGet down from there this instant!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SThis is outrageous! Government<<CRLF>>buildings are not for climbing!<<CRLF>>
#10509FC-Commander, calm down!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10509FWhat if she climbed up there to...you<<CRLF>>know...<<CRLF>>
#10509FWhat are you going to do if she jumps?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10010FWh-what?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10601FIf she jumps down here from that high<<CRLF>>up, all because you told her to get down...<<CRLF>>
#10604FCommander, you'd be a murderer!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FGrr... Well, what am I supposed to do,<<CRLF>>then?!<<CRLF>>
#10001FThis wasn't in my job description!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10500FYou'll have to try and persuade her to<<CRLF>>climb back down.<<CRLF>>
#10500FMake her realize how much she has to<<CRLF>>live for.<<CRLF>>
#10010FWh-why should I have to do that?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10603FWell, maintaining order in the city is<<CRLF>>your job, isn't it?<<CRLF>>
#10005FI...I suppose I have no choice, then...er...<<CRLF>>*cough*<<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SYou, up there! Can you hear me?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SDon't do anything foolish! Think of<<CRLF>>your parents!<<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SIf you jump from all the way<<CRLF>>up there, it's really going to<<CRLF>>hurt, you know!
#10002F#16SAnd think of all the food you'll<<CRLF>>never be able to eat again!<<CRLF>>
#10501F...I don't think she can hear you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10601FGuess you're going to have to climb up<<CRLF>>there yourself.<<CRLF>>
#10005FP-preposterous! I could never...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10603FAre you scared, Commander?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FOf course not!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10603FYou are! You're scared!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SI am not! I am not, I say!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001F...Ah, Adol! Perfect timing!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FI...well...I'll let you have the honor of<<CRLF>>taking care of this situation. As...as a<<CRLF>>show of good faith, yes!
I'll do it.
I politely decline.
#10003FI knew you would!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10003FCome along, now, I'm sure you don't<<CRLF>>really mean that...<<CRLF>>
Resident
Leo! Go save her yourself!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FWh-who said that?! You will address me<<CRLF>>as COMMANDER Leo!<<CRLF>>
Resident
Saving people is the army's job!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yeah! Don't make Adol do all your work for you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's your turn to do something useful for<<CRLF>>a change!<<CRLF>>
Go on, Leo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Leo! Leo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#18SLeo! Leo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FWow, they're all cheering for him...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10500FI think they're just enjoying the spectacle.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10500FBut especially now, with the Romun<<CRLF>>Army here, he's going to look terrible if<<CRLF>>he doesn't go.
#10006FGrrr...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SI said you will address me as<<CRLF>>COMMANDER Leo!!<<CRLF>>
#10602FHe's running away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10509F...Wait, look over there! I think he's<<CRLF>>trying to get to higher ground!<<CRLF>>
H-he's pretty fast...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*whistle* That's our Roaring Leo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Resident
Wow, he's actually scaling the wall!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I didn't think he'd be that brave!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Leo! Leo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#18SLeo! Leo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Resident
#0M#16SSh-she jumped!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0M#16SEeeeeeek!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203F#18S#00257VAdol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Y-you're hurting me!
What are you doing here?
#00203F#2MHahaha, sorry! I'm just so happy to see<<CRLF>>you again!<<CRLF>>
#00203F#2MI've been looking for you everywhere!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100F...What is the meaning of this<<CRLF>>commotion?<<CRLF>>
#10007F#16S#00937V#0MLet me down! I'm scared of heights!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sancho and Panza
#16S#00953VCommander, take it easy!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Did you have a look at the board?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I did.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Heheh, of course you did!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So that means you're up for our challenge?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I sure hope so!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Maybe? That's not an answer!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh well, we'll tell you what we want you to do<<CRLF>>anyway.<<CRLF>>
We want you to accept our challenge!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I accept your challenge!
Hold on...
Heheh, getting scared?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, you let us know when you're ready!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We'll be waiting here for you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, are you ready?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We want you to accept our challenge!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I accept your challenge!
Just a bit longer, please.
You're STILL not ready?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Are you the kind of person who enjoys<<CRLF>>teasing others, Adol?<<CRLF>>
Yeeeeah! There we go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Okay, here's what we want you to do.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We want you to show us how skilled a treasure<<CRLF>>hunter you are!<<CRLF>>
You're working on a map of the Great Forest,<<CRLF>>right?<<CRLF>>
So we thought you must be an expert at<<CRLF>>treasure hunting, too.<<CRLF>>
That's why we've hidden treasures all around<<CRLF>>town, and we want you to find them!<<CRLF>>
You're gonna be looking for lots of gold<<CRLF>>ore, those super-expensive little rocks they<<CRLF>>make gold stuff out of.
If you find them, you can keep them as your<<CRLF>>reward.<<CRLF>>
We've hidden five of them in total.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Come let us know when you've found all five!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll be back in no time!
Do I get any hints?
Heheh, that's the spirit!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yep. This is what we wanted to see!<<CRLF>>Goooooooo Adol!<<CRLF>>
Wait, before you go! If you want any hints--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What? What does he need hints for?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The whole point of a treasure hunt is to find<<CRLF>>treasure with riddles or clues to guide you.<<CRLF>>
It's not much of a treasure hunt if he's just<<CRLF>>looking around blindly. That would be boring!<<CRLF>>
What? What do you need hints for?! I thought<<CRLF>>you were a better treasure hunter than that!<<CRLF>>
Well, it's not much of a treasure hunt without<<CRLF>>hints. At that point, it's more of a scavenger<<CRLF>>hunt, right?
The whole point of a treasure hunt is to find<<CRLF>>treasure with riddles or clues to guide you.<<CRLF>>
Just looking around the whole city trying to<<CRLF>>find tiny treasure would be really boring.<<CRLF>>
I guess you're right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's decided! If you need a clue as to where<<CRLF>>the treasures are hidden, come speak to me.<<CRLF>>
Oh, and if you really can't find one and want<<CRLF>>to give up...<<CRLF>>
...just come and let me know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You'll have to admit we've beaten you if you<<CRLF>>give up, though! And you don't wanna do that,<<CRLF>>now, would you?
I think that's all we got for you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All right, Evan.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Okay, on the count of three...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
One, two...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Evan and Lyle
#18SGOOOO!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ooh, looks like you found them all!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And really quickly, too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wow, you're amazing! It's no wonder you've<<CRLF>>managed to explore so much of the Great Forest<<CRLF>>already.
I hate to admit it, but I really do wanna be<<CRLF>>like you one day.<<CRLF>>
H-hey, Adol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Since you beat us, here. Take this too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh, go ahead! It won't bite!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's not like it's hard to find more.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You should be able to refine all of those into<<CRLF>>something useful.<<CRLF>>
I hope they'll be helpful to you when you're<<CRLF>>out exploring the Great Forest!<<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Challenge!'
#4CFound all of the hidden gold ore stashes!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CFound all of the hidden gold ore stashes!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You there! What do you think you're doing?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I was looking for gold ore.
Do I really have to tell you?
Gold ore, you say? Really? In a place like this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... You're definitely suspicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I think I'm going to have to ask you to come<<CRLF>>with me and explain what you're REALLY up to.<<CRLF>>
Of course you do! Are you trying to get smart<<CRLF>>with me?<<CRLF>>
If you don't want to talk, I'm going to have to<<CRLF>>assume you're involved in something suspicious.<<CRLF>>
I think I'll need to ask you to come with me<<CRLF>>and explain what you're REALLY up to.<<CRLF>>
Oh dear, what seems to be the problem?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10200FMy, my, if it isn't Adol Christin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10200FIs something the matter?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol explained the situation to Gruda.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10200FSo you decided to accept a request from<<CRLF>>those children and play with them?<<CRLF>>
#10203FHow delightful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
U-um...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10205FAs you heard, there is nothing suspicious<<CRLF>>about this young man.<<CRLF>>
#10201FIn fact, the only problem here seems to<<CRLF>>be that a guard permitted a child to tres-<<CRLF>>pass in this area while on duty.
#10201FSo unless you want me to report your<<CRLF>>error, I'd suggest you return to your post<<CRLF>>immediately.
Y-yes, sir!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you.
Nicely done!
#10206FOh, it was nothing. If anything, we owe<<CRLF>>you an apology for the inconvenience.<<CRLF>>
#10206FHeh. Thank you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10200FI'm glad to hear such a compliment from<<CRLF>>an explorer of your standing.<<CRLF>>
#10200F...Though I can't help noticing your usual<<CRLF>>companion is not with you today. Where<<CRLF>>could he be, I wonder?
#10205FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Is something the matter?
Did you have business with Duren?
#10200FOh, no, I'd just heard that the two of you<<CRLF>>are inseparable of late, so I was merely<<CRLF>>a bit surprised.
#10200FPlease pass my regards to your partner<<CRLF>>when next you see him.<<CRLF>>
#10200FAh, so his name is Duren?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10200FNo, I did not, but do pass along my best<<CRLF>>regards to him as well.<<CRLF>>
#10200F...Is something the matter?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ask about the Primeval Lands
Ask about the tower
#10200FThe Primeval Lands, you say?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10206FI do recall hearing that the residents of<<CRLF>>the Great Forest refer to the other side<<CRLF>>of the river as such.
#10200FGovernor General Griselda has filled me<<CRLF>>in on your exploits, so I'm eager to learn<<CRLF>>more about it myself.
#10200FA tower?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10200FIs there a tower in the Great Forest?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10205FI've been kept informed of your investi-<<CRLF>>gation by Governor General Griselda, but<<CRLF>>I don't recall any reference to a tower...
#10203FI'm actually a little surprised you would<<CRLF>>ask me such a thing, in fact.<<CRLF>>
#10203FThe Romun Army is only just beginning its<<CRLF>>expedition into the Great Forest. You have<<CRLF>>much more to tell me than I to you.
Sir, preparations for training are complete.<<CRLF>>We can begin as soon as you're ready.<<CRLF>>
#10200FVery well. I will be along shortly.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10200FI do apologize, Adol, but I'm afraid I have<<CRLF>>work to attend to.<<CRLF>>
#10206FI hope, though, that we will have the<<CRLF>>chance to speak again in the near future.<<CRLF>>
#4CFound all of the hidden gold ore stashes!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo there are a few shops in Casnan<<CRLF>>worth mentioning.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat is Billy's Curios.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHe sells all kinds of items, from health<<CRLF>>potions to antidotes.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd that is Thomas' Armory.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAs the name suggests, he's your man if<<CRLF>>you need any new weapons or armor.<<CRLF>>
#00103F...Shall we have a look over there, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FFinally! We've wrapped up my grand tour<<CRLF>>of Casnan.<<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* What a pain... If you hadn't gone<<CRLF>>and lost your memories, I wouldn't have<<CRLF>>had to bother showing you it all again!
Thank Duren for his kindness
Pretend to be deeply offended
#00109FO-oh, it was nothing...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FSmall potatoes compared to all the money<<CRLF>>I'll make working with you!<<CRLF>>
#00110FWh-whoa, hold on a minute, I was only<<CRLF>>joking!<<CRLF>>
#00110FI didn't think you'd take it so personally...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol admitted he was only joking as well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FOh, so you're a wise guy now, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FYou may not remember who you were<<CRLF>>before, but I'll tell you one thing: you<<CRLF>>weren't THAT GUY.
#00100FWhelp, that's pretty much Casnan in a<<CRLF>>nutshell.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo! Time to start planning how we're<<CRLF>>going to tackle the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
Ooh, looks like you have something to cure<<CRLF>>the little guy's hangover!<<CRLF>>
So what did you bring?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Give Antidote Powder
Give Anti-Paralysis Powder
Give Purification Powder
Give Catholicon
Don't give her anything

Oh, you changed your mind?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I see... That's a shame.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Working at the mine's a really worthwhile job.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you ever decide you'd like to join us, you're<<CRLF>>always welcome.<<CRLF>>
All right, time to work up a sweat!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Us miners get along really well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
See, we men 're connected through our work,<<CRLF>>so we don't care about upbringing or background<<CRLF>>or any o' that stuff.
Why is my daughter so cute?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh Minmi, I can't wait to get home and see you<<CRLF>>again!<<CRLF>>
*sigh* Seem to be gettin' tired easier these<<CRLF>>days. I guess I'm just startin' to get on in<<CRLF>>years, huh?
Oh, did you come about the quest?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The head miner's a short way past the main<<CRLF>>entrance.<<CRLF>>
Hey, good job. Heard you were helpin' us out a<<CRLF>>bit today, right?<<CRLF>>
How'd you find it? Doesn't it feel great to work<<CRLF>>up a sweat?<<CRLF>>

Heheh, thanks! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well then, today's scoop is about everyone's<<CRLF>>favorite Governor General, Griselda.<<CRLF>>

Today's scoop is about the eccentric explorer<<CRLF>>duo, Rabbit and Pigeon.<<CRLF>>
There's a certain awkwardness between them,<<CRLF>>don't you think? Like they're just starting<<CRLF>>to date, even though they used to be lovers!
It's like they don't know what to do with one<<CRLF>>another. Innocent as can be! Don't see them<<CRLF>>around here much anymore, though.

He's actually a former miner.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And with a build like that, a really good one,<<CRLF>>as you might imagine! But one day he just<<CRLF>>announced he was going to pursue his dreams.
'High-quality muscles come from high-quality<<CRLF>>food!', he said.<<CRLF>>

Well, fine! See if I care!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks again for today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I was having doubts about whether or not<<CRLF>>I really wanted to keep doing this job, but<<CRLF>>thanks to you I've made up my mind.
*sigh* I'm a little bit tired today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Maybe I should look for another job...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Maybe it's because exploring the Great Forest<<CRLF>>is harder than people expected, but lately,<<CRLF>>there just haven't been many tourists here.
It's always the same few people. It's soooo<<CRLF>>boring...<<CRLF>>
Everything's back to normal here, now that all<<CRLF>>those soldiers have left.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* And normal is just so bland...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, if it isn't my favorite cold-hearted yet<<CRLF>>unbelievably handsome young man!<<CRLF>>

Would you care to have some fun with me?<<CRLF>>I'll give you the time of your life! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Leo around<<CRLF>>here lately.<<CRLF>>
I wonder if he's coming back soon...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We really are fortunate, when you think about<<CRLF>>it.<<CRLF>>
We probably should be more grateful for what<<CRLF>>we've got, rather than taking it all for<<CRLF>>granted.
Have you heard the latest rumor? Apparently<<CRLF>>there's a really big town in the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
I find it a little hard to believe, myself...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That man in charge of the Romun Army...<<CRLF>>Gruda, was it?<<CRLF>>
He's got a cute face, but he's shorter than<<CRLF>>I expected.<<CRLF>>
You know those new soldiers who showed up?<<CRLF>>The ones from Romn? Everyone seems to act<<CRLF>>more...'proper' whenever they're around.
I wonder where Leo went?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Have you heard the latest news? Apparently two<<CRLF>>villages have been found in the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>Two!
I wonder what kinds of people live there...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, are you having steak this evening as well?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm, that's a wonderful idea! Perhaps I'll also<<CRLF>>have steak.<<CRLF>>
Hey, did you hear about Leo? Apparently he ran<<CRLF>>away in our hour of need...once again.<<CRLF>>
And yet he's always so full of himself!<<CRLF>>He really needs to start doing his job,<<CRLF>>and stop pretending he's such a big deal.
You're absolutely right. He's always so annoying<<CRLF>>and noisy when he's around...<<CRLF>>
But when he's not, it feels rather lonely,<<CRLF>>somehow!<<CRLF>>
You're quite right there. I have plenty of<<CRLF>>money, so I certainly don't need to hold back.<<CRLF>>
It helps that I'm blessed by a wonderful family.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I heard that too, but I find it hard to believe.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's probably just a lie dreamed up by some<<CRLF>>explorer who wants to make a name for<<CRLF>>himself.
That's true. I like the look of the officer<<CRLF>>who's sometimes with him, though.<<CRLF>>
He's slim, and he looks so handsome with that<<CRLF>>long hair of his!<<CRLF>>
I heard Leo's gone into the Great Forest again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's going to be so boring here without him.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So I heard. Apparently it was Adol who<<CRLF>>discovered both of them as well.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure Leo's frustrated at not being the<<CRLF>>first one there. But, it serves him right!<<CRLF>>
Indeed, there's nothing like meat to fill you<<CRLF>>with energy!<<CRLF>>
My husband needs to keep working hard.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So I heard. He really is hopeless.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wasn't it Adol who ended up sorting everything<<CRLF>>out, too?<<CRLF>>
Can't someone give him Leo's job instead?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Erm...one of them is hidden in a place where<<CRLF>>adults often drink from big mugs and say,<<CRLF>>'Ahhhh!'
And their breath usually smells, too. But if<<CRLF>>I say any more, it's going to give it away!<<CRLF>>
It's a fairly big place, so have a good look<<CRLF>>around.<<CRLF>>
Erm...one of them is hidden in a house in the<<CRLF>>lower part of town, with a different-colored<<CRLF>>roof than the houses around it.
I left this one to Evan, and I think he said he<<CRLF>>put it somewhere near the cooking area?<<CRLF>>Something like that.
Erm...one of them is hidden near an animal that<<CRLF>>people can ride around on.<<CRLF>>
It's pretty strong, too, so it can even carry<<CRLF>>luggage for people. Does that make it any<<CRLF>>easier?
Erm...one of them is hidden in a dark, kind of<<CRLF>>sketchy alley.<<CRLF>>
There are a lot of suspicious-looking people<<CRLF>>there, so if you don't find it quickly, someone<<CRLF>>might steal it. Does that make it any easier?
Erm...one of them is hidden under a tent with<<CRLF>>a cross and a circle on it.<<CRLF>>

So bye!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There are so many wildly different rumors about<<CRLF>>the Primeval Lands, I just have no idea what to<<CRLF>>believe.
Personally, I'd like to believe the one that<<CRLF>>says it's a paradise full of beautiful women,<<CRLF>>but that sounds too good to be true!
There are so many wildly different rumors about<<CRLF>>the Primeval Lands... Some even say there's<<CRLF>>nothing there at all.
If it really is just covered with primeval<<CRLF>>forests, though... Man, that'd be so boring!<<CRLF>>
Have you heard the latest rumor? Apparently<<CRLF>>there's a utopia called the Primeval Lands on<<CRLF>>the other side of the river.
And it's supposed to be filled with nothing but<<CRLF>>beautiful women!<<CRLF>>
...It doesn't sound very realistic, but what<<CRLF>>man wouldn't want that to be real?<<CRLF>>
First the Romun Army left for the Great Forest,<<CRLF>>and now even Governor General Griselda has<<CRLF>>gone in there too!
She really is a brave woman, I've gotta hand it<<CRLF>>to her.<<CRLF>>
Man, it was fun messing with Leo yesterday.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Still, I don't think anyone actually expected<<CRLF>>him to climb that wall.<<CRLF>>

Leo might actually be pretty tough.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He's always out for glory, but he doesn't seem<<CRLF>>to have any malicious intentions.<<CRLF>>
Hey, Adol. Seems like you made quite the<<CRLF>>discovery.<<CRLF>>
Finding a settlement before anyone else is<<CRLF>>a pretty impressive achievement.<<CRLF>>
Keep it up! We need someone who'll put Leo<<CRLF>>to shame.<<CRLF>>

Either way, Leo not being in town is a good<<CRLF>>thing in and of itself.<<CRLF>>
Judging by your red hair, you must be that Adol<<CRLF>>fellow who took down that monster in the mine,<<CRLF>>right?
You've got a whole lot of guts for someone your<<CRLF>>age.<<CRLF>>

Do you believe in the power of words?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I do. Words make up the world around us,<<CRLF>>after all.<<CRLF>>
People aren't inherently special...but there<<CRLF>>is someone who's special to me.<<CRLF>>
The world is made up of different perspectives.<<CRLF>>It's simple, yet complex.<<CRLF>>
People often say there's no limit to human<<CRLF>>desire, but is that really true?<<CRLF>>
You can only desire that which you imagine...<<CRLF>>meaning one's desire has the same limits<<CRLF>>as one's imagination.
Human history is just an endless repeating<<CRLF>>cycle.<<CRLF>>
People say we have to learn from the past, but<<CRLF>>that's really just an excuse.<<CRLF>>
Are you someone who faces difficulties head-on?<<CRLF>>Or someone who turns their back on them?<<CRLF>>
I'm the latter, but that doesn't mean I'm<<CRLF>>running away.<<CRLF>>
Everyone just has their own way of dealing with<<CRLF>>problems, that's all.<<CRLF>>
Everyone just has their own way of dealing with<<CRLF>>problems.<<CRLF>>
No one can say it's impossible to overcome a<<CRLF>>problem by turning your back on it.<<CRLF>>
You can't control the flow of the ages, but<<CRLF>>you can guide it in the direction you desire...<<CRLF>>
Are you one who creates new currents? Or one<<CRLF>>who allows himself to be guided by them?<<CRLF>>
Compared with nature, we humans are truly<<CRLF>>powerless. That's why we must support one<<CRLF>>another.
You must understand that you're not alone...<<CRLF>>That's the most important part of living.<<CRLF>>
So you're the one who defeated the monster...<<CRLF>>I believe I noticed you before others began to<<CRLF>>speak of your deeds.
...Are you going into the Great Forest again?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're either reckless or just plain foolish...<<CRLF>>But your ill-advised madness is strangely<<CRLF>>admirable.
...Are you going into the Great Forest again?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

I've made up my mind! I'm going to take him<<CRLF>>home with me!<<CRLF>>
And then his paws will be all mine! I won't<<CRLF>>share them with anyone!<<CRLF>>
Aaah, I can't stop touching them!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm hungry, but I want to stroke his paws more<<CRLF>>than I want to eat.<<CRLF>>
*squish*...*squish*...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*squish*...*squishysquishysquishysquishy*...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Paws are such wonderful things.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I just can't stop touching them! I could do this<<CRLF>>all day! Or all week! Or even all year!<<CRLF>>
I wonder if he'd be okay with me touching his<<CRLF>>belly. Aww, who cares! I'm going to do it<<CRLF>>anyway!
Ooh, this feels nice too...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's warm, and soft...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So warm and soft...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm going to do it. I'm going to touch it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oooh, it's so silky! I didn't expect it to feel<<CRLF>>so silky...<<CRLF>>
*stroke* *stroke*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oooh, it's so silky! I didn't expect it to feel<<CRLF>>so silky...<<CRLF>>
I kind of want to stroke it, and yet I don't...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't know what to do...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Should I try stroking it? I don't know if I'm<<CRLF>>brave enough for that.<<CRLF>>
What if it bites me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I-I'm always nervous around cats...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But there's something about this one that just<<CRLF>>draws me in.<<CRLF>>
Mreeeoooooowwwwnnn... <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

But his slovenliness is part of his charm,<<CRLF>>I suppose.<<CRLF>>

*squish*...*squish*...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, his meat quality...er, I mean, his body's<<CRLF>>softened up quite a bit.<<CRLF>>
A pikkard that loves alcohol... This can't be<<CRLF>>normal, can it?<<CRLF>>
Although I'm the one who keeps giving it to him,<<CRLF>>so I suppose it's my fault, really.<<CRLF>>
The more I give him, the more I realize how<<CRLF>>well he holds his liquor!<<CRLF>>
*sigh* He's such a lush.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

It's only just occurred to me, but there are a<<CRLF>>lot fewer conflicts between the people here and<<CRLF>>the occupying Romun government lately.
I suppose it goes without saying that that's<<CRLF>>largely due to Governor General Griselda.<<CRLF>>
That's a huge deal when you think about it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder what the Romun Army are doing now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
They haven't returned since leaving for the<<CRLF>>Great Forest... Has something happened to them?<<CRLF>>
Everyone's talking about the Primeval Lands<<CRLF>>these days.<<CRLF>>
They seem to have set everyone's imaginations<<CRLF>>alight, but none of the rumors sound very<<CRLF>>credible to me.
It seems like the whole of the Romun Army has<<CRLF>>entered the Great Forest now.<<CRLF>>
...I wonder how it must feel to be sent there<<CRLF>>on a mission...<<CRLF>>
If it were me, I'd probably run away at the last<<CRLF>>minute.<<CRLF>>
I still can't believe that whole incident with<<CRLF>>the girl jumping off the building yesterday.<<CRLF>>
The most unbelievable thing about it, though,<<CRLF>>is that Leo actually thought he'd be able to<<CRLF>>talk someone down like that!
...But I have to admit, I was impressed to see<<CRLF>>him actually climb up there. He's got more guts<<CRLF>>than I gave him credit for.
The Romun Army soldiers are a lot more mena-<<CRLF>>cing than the Celcetan Army soldiers. Maybe it's<<CRLF>>the fact that they've got better equipment.
I'll have to be careful not to do anything<<CRLF>>that draws attention to myself!<<CRLF>>
Thanks to the gold rush, Casnan's a lot livelier<<CRLF>>than it used to be.<<CRLF>>
To be honest, though, I preferred it the way it<<CRLF>>was.<<CRLF>>
It's a lot harder to relax with this many<<CRLF>>people around.<<CRLF>>
The Governor General has said she'll be<<CRLF>>rewarding those who can map out the Great<<CRLF>>Forest.
It's a hefty sum, apparently, so a lot of people<<CRLF>>have started gathering here to try.<<CRLF>>
But if you ask any of us locals, it's the<<CRLF>>ultimate fool's errand. You'd have to be out<<CRLF>>of your mind to go in there!
Whiny Young Man
Hey, when's Commander Leo coming back?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It'll be too late if he comes back after more<<CRLF>>people get hurt. Somebody needs to tell him<<CRLF>>to hurry up!
Are explorers usually rich?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Not that I really want to explore the world,<<CRLF>>mind you. But if I could find a nice explorer<<CRLF>>to settle down with, that would just be lovely!
When it comes down to it, the life you lead de-<<CRLF>>pends entirely on your partner. By which I mean<<CRLF>>how much money you have to spend, of course!
If only there were a handsome, brave, rich man<<CRLF>>out there who would love only me...<<CRLF>>
Big cities sound magical, but I hear only a<<CRLF>>limited number of people can truly appreciate<<CRLF>>the pleasures they have to offer.
And I certainly don't want to end up poor,<<CRLF>>outcast and humiliated! So what should I do?<<CRLF>>
I hear there are places called 'bath houses' in<<CRLF>>the big cities.<<CRLF>>
They sound wonderful. I'd love to go to one<<CRLF>>someday.<<CRLF>>
The operas featured in big city theater houses<<CRLF>>sound truly breathtaking!<<CRLF>>
I get all atwitter just thinking about them...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Gladiator fights in the big city sound like<<CRLF>>true spectacles.<<CRLF>>
It gets my blood bubbling just thinking about<<CRLF>>them!<<CRLF>>
Casnan is booming because of the gold rush.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But that doesn't change the fact that it's just<<CRLF>>a small rural city.<<CRLF>>
I'd really love to go to a big city someday...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It seems there are a variety of recreational<<CRLF>>facilities in the big city.<<CRLF>>
You can watch gladiator fights at the coliseum,<<CRLF>>operas at the theater... It must be wonderful to<<CRLF>>live in the lap of such luxury!
That red hair...<<CRLF>>Might you be Adol?<<CRLF>>
You seem so kind, yet you have the strength to<<CRLF>>defeat a monster...<<CRLF>>
You're simply the dreamiest!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I heard there was trouble here and decided to<<CRLF>>come see for myself. It doesn't seem as though<<CRLF>>getting any closer would be wise, however.
I think I'll keep my distance and watch the<<CRLF>>drama unfold from afar.<<CRLF>>
I'm not gonna be selfish anymore. I'm gonna be<<CRLF>>a good big sister!<<CRLF>>
Yesterday I even ate my mushrooms! Aren't I<<CRLF>>a good girl?<<CRLF>>
One day I'm gonna be an older sister.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But older sisters aren't allowed to be<<CRLF>>selfish... *sniffle*<<CRLF>>
I'm really greedy.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I want eeeeeverything!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I learned to write my own name!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Next I'm gonna learn to write Daddy's name too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Every time Mommy tells me a story, I always<<CRLF>>feel sleepy.<<CRLF>>
...I'll find out what Mommy and Daddy are doing<<CRLF>>next time.<<CRLF>>
Mommy and Daddy seem to be doing something<<CRLF>>secret after I go to sleep.<<CRLF>>
Today I'm gonna stay awake and find out what<<CRLF>>it is!<<CRLF>>
When I get bigger, I'm gonna marry Daddy!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Alcohol is my life, sir.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't want to imagine a life without alcohol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Every drop of alcohol is as precious as a drop<<CRLF>>of blood, sir.<<CRLF>>
No matter what, it should never be wasted.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I cannot drink the Muscle Wine at the bar, sir.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I...just can't do it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

They're truly a miraculous combination.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Froth is the most important part of a beer, sir.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Beer without froth is like an unfattened<<CRLF>>pikkard.<<CRLF>>
I prefer wine to beer, sir.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
However, my first drink of the day is always a<<CRLF>>beer.<<CRLF>>
I can't wait to finish work and start drinking.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It is truly what keeps me going, sir.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It seems the Romun Army soldiers in the Great<<CRLF>>Forest are alive and well, though I don't know<<CRLF>>much more than that.
Judging by the chaos at headquarters, it seems<<CRLF>>something major is going to happen soon.<<CRLF>>
Not much information about what's going on in<<CRLF>>the Great Forest reaches us guardsmen, but we<<CRLF>>at least know if our fellow soldiers are safe.
Seems Commander Leo and his men are well<<CRLF>>accounted for, at the very least. That alone<<CRLF>>is quite reassuring.
I find him difficult to deal with, but that<<CRLF>>doesn't mean I'd want anything to happen to him.<<CRLF>>
...Even if it would make sense for me to wish<<CRLF>>him ill, all things considered.<<CRLF>>
The Governor General won't confirm or deny<<CRLF>>any of the rumors fluttering about.<<CRLF>>
But I wouldn't be surprised if one of them were<<CRLF>>actually true.<<CRLF>>
Of course, there's no way a low-ranking soldier<<CRLF>>like me would ever be privy to such information.<<CRLF>>
All of the Romun Army soldiers who entered the<<CRLF>>Great Forest were wearing the same suspicious-<<CRLF>>looking mask.
I haven't been briefed on any protective face<<CRLF>>gear, so that struck me as rather odd indeed.<<CRLF>>
Even if it's some kind of cutting-edge<<CRLF>>equipment, the whole army wearing masks<<CRLF>>like that is...very, very creepy.
I wonder why all the Imperial Army soldiers were<<CRLF>>wearing masks...<<CRLF>>
Even if it's some kind of cutting-edge<<CRLF>>equipment, the whole army wearing masks<<CRLF>>like that is...very, very creepy.
When they're not training, the Romun Army<<CRLF>>soldiers seem to be free to do whatever they<<CRLF>>want.
There are several of them in the bar already.<<CRLF>>I wish I could join them...<<CRLF>>
Sending the Romun Army to a remote region like<<CRLF>>this seems like a waste of resources. Romn must<<CRLF>>really be eager to find more veins of gold.
Considering how much there is to be found,<<CRLF>>however, I suppose it makes sense.<<CRLF>>
The reward money being offered seems to have<<CRLF>>drawn a fair number of competent-looking<<CRLF>>prospectors and explorers here.
But the expedition of the Great Forest is only<<CRLF>>just beginning, so don't you let your guard down<<CRLF>>in there!
You're going into the Great Forest too?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm sure you've been told this a thousand times<<CRLF>>already, but it's a truly dangerous place. Be<<CRLF>>extremely careful, and take lots of supplies.
W-well, you see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
J-just wait a little longer, please. We'll sort<<CRLF>>things out shortly.<<CRLF>>
Nothing out of the ordinary today, either!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Although the atmosphere in the General<<CRLF>>Government Building is a little tense.<<CRLF>>
Nothing out of the ordinary today, either!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's almost extraordinary just how little is<<CRLF>>out of the ordinary!<<CRLF>>

I can't say for sure there'll be nothing out of<<CRLF>>the ordinary next year or the year after, however.<<CRLF>>
Nothing out of the ordinary today, either!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm sure there'll be nothing out of the<<CRLF>>ordinary tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,<<CRLF>>too!
I'm patrolling today, as usual.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The Romun Army's arrival doesn't affect my<<CRLF>>duties in any way.<<CRLF>>
...What I do is the very definition of monotony.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I...I saw something I probably shouldn't have<<CRLF>>seen in the warehouse.<<CRLF>>
It was a giant wooden box the Romun Army had<<CRLF>>carried in. What could be inside? It seemed like<<CRLF>>it must be pretty important...
...I, uh, probably shouldn't be talking to<<CRLF>>civilians about this, should I? I'm not very<<CRLF>>good at my job sometimes.
Please pretend I didn't say anything.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...I, uh, probably shouldn't be talking to<<CRLF>>civilians about this, should I? I'm not very<<CRLF>>good at my job sometimes.
Please pretend I didn't say anything.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The duties of soldiers assigned to the General<<CRLF>>Government Building are mostly just training and<<CRLF>>patrols. That's all we do here.
...It gets ludicrously monotonous.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
On the left, you'll find the soldiers' barracks.<<CRLF>>On the right is the cafeteria. And straight<<CRLF>>ahead you'll find the Celcetan Headquarters.
The layout is quite simple, so I doubt there's<<CRLF>>any chance of getting lost. Unless, of course,<<CRLF>>you're a moron.
I heard from one of the Romun soldiers the other<<CRLF>>day that Commander Leo used to be a pretty<<CRLF>>famous general.
But a few years ago, he disobeyed an officer<<CRLF>>of noble birth and wound up getting sent here.<<CRLF>>
Apparently, it all started because he was<<CRLF>>covering for one of his subordinates who'd<<CRLF>>made some sort of grievous mistake.
All this time I've been making fun of him, but<<CRLF>>from the sounds of it, he's actually a pretty<<CRLF>>great guy!
I wonder why he doesn't tell anyone about that<<CRLF>>incident...<<CRLF>>
Either way, I definitely have a higher opinion<<CRLF>>of him than I did previously.<<CRLF>>
I haven't seen Commander Leo around here for a<<CRLF>>while.<<CRLF>>
He's like a yapping dog. Annoying when he's<<CRLF>>here, but you miss him when he's gone.<<CRLF>>
I haven't heard Commander Leo's trademark<<CRLF>>shouting lately.<<CRLF>>
...It's kind of boring around here without him.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Commander Leo's hairstyle certainly is unique.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Pff...hahaha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All I have to do is picture it in my head and<<CRLF>>I burst out laughing! I need to get this under<<CRLF>>control before I see him next, or else...pfff...
Just picturing the Commander's hairstyle makes<<CRLF>>me laugh.<<CRLF>>
If the Commander sees me like this, I'm really<<CRLF>>going to be in for it!<<CRLF>>
Have you ever seen Commander Leo fight with<<CRLF>>a sword?<<CRLF>>
He has a pretty unique stance, but he's actually<<CRLF>>rather strong. It's...unexpected.<<CRLF>>
Gruda...er, I mean, Sir Gruda...<<CRLF>>There's something about that man. Something<<CRLF>>that's...strangely intimidating.
*cough* S-So don't you go causing any<<CRLF>>more trouble, you hear?!<<CRLF>>
If I said I didn't want to enter the Great<<CRLF>>Forest at all, I'd be lying. I'm a man with<<CRLF>>dreams, after all!
But being stuck with Commander Leo the whole<<CRLF>>time...is more than I could handle.<<CRLF>>
*yawn*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...N-no, sir, I was not yawning, sir! I was<<CRLF>>just...<<CRLF>>
Wait, you're not Commander Leo! Don't scare<<CRLF>>me like that.<<CRLF>>
...Guess I'm free to yawn, though. *yawn*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Commander Leo's far too strict when it comes to<<CRLF>>regulations and behavior.<<CRLF>>
He's right and all, but there's no need to go<<CRLF>>on and on about it.<<CRLF>>
This is the Romun General Government Building.<<CRLF>>Civilians aren't allowed to enter, but an<<CRLF>>exception is made for those mapping the forest.
That doesn't give you an excuse to go poking<<CRLF>>your nose in places it doesn't belong, though!<<CRLF>>
Aaah, what a great meal!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Well, great food, anyway. The less said about<<CRLF>>that weirdly-named drink, the better!<<CRLF>>
Wonder how I should spend what little time<<CRLF>>I have left until I'm called into duty...<<CRLF>>
Yeah, I'd have enjoyed it a lot more if not for<<CRLF>>that.<<CRLF>>
Well, how about we do some shopping?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It couldn't hurt to wander around a bit and<<CRLF>>waste some time...<<CRLF>>
Mining sure is risky work.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I just hope they all make it out okay!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That's not Leo over there, is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Actually, it's a woman, so I suppose not.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm...I don't remember seeing anyone like<<CRLF>>that in the Celcetan Army...<<CRLF>>
#00100FOh, I guess that's the new Governor<<CRLF>>General everyone's been talking about.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSeems like quite the go-getter, from<<CRLF>>the looks of it.<<CRLF>>
I wonder when Leo's going to show up...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He really does have the worst timing. Though<<CRLF>>I suppose I shouldn't say that too loudly<<CRLF>>around here...
I know it's not very nice, but I kinda came<<CRLF>>here just to see the Romuns running around<<CRLF>>in a panic.
I certainly wasn't expecting this!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That Governor General Griselda actually<<CRLF>>behaves...competently!<<CRLF>>
#10101FThere's no time to waste! Arrange for<<CRLF>>additional personnel here at once!<<CRLF>>
Y-yes, ma'am!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He said there are three miners still trapped<<CRLF>>inside, but everyone else is safe and sound.<<CRLF>>
A few got injured, but fortunately no one's<<CRLF>>died. Not yet, anyway...<<CRLF>>
Now we just need the head miner and the<<CRLF>>others to come out alive. I really hope<<CRLF>>they're okay!
Occasionally we'll stumble upon a ruin while<<CRLF>>digging, and strange creatures will start<<CRLF>>showing up.
It's not like this is the first time that's<<CRLF>>happened.<<CRLF>>
But the closer we get to the Great Forest, the<<CRLF>>more vicious the monsters we find are.<<CRLF>>
This is why I've always been against digging<<CRLF>>anywhere near that place!<<CRLF>>
This is why I've always been against digging<<CRLF>>anywhere near that place!<<CRLF>>
Dammit...<<CRLF>>All I can do is pray they're all safe.<<CRLF>>
You need to focus on resting, not blaming<<CRLF>>yourself, okay?<<CRLF>>
Come on, have a drink of water and<<CRLF>>calm down.<<CRLF>>
The head miner and the others got trapped in<<CRLF>>a room with a huge monster...<<CRLF>>
I'm so ashamed of myself for not being able to<<CRLF>>do anything. How could I just run away like<<CRLF>>that?!
#4CA large notice is displayed, advertising a job to draw up a map of<<CRLF>>the Great Forest and listing a hefty sum of money as payment.<<CRLF>>
#4CVarious notices are displayed from the Governor General to the<<CRLF>>residents of Casnan.<<CRLF>>
#4CThis way seems to lead to a large building. There's no reason to be<<CRLF>>here right now.<<CRLF>>
#4CThis appears to be a back alley. There's no reason to be going this<<CRLF>>way right now.<<CRLF>>
#4CThe mine seems to be the place where something big is happening.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe miners don't seem to have come this way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe commotion seems to be coming from the opposite direction.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThis isn't the way to the mine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThat strange light seems awfully suspicious. It might be prudent to<<CRLF>>investigate it before doing anything else.<<CRLF>>
Meeheehee! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Meeeeeheeeee!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Large Blue-Haired Man
#00900FThanks to you, we managed to find those<<CRLF>>wild Celcetan Flowers for Dr. Flair's medi-<<CRLF>>cine a lot faster than we thought.
#00900FHe says he's gonna head back to Esteria<<CRLF>>and start experimenting with them as<<CRLF>>soon as possible.
#00903FHe was up first thing this morning, doing<<CRLF>>exercises...waaaay too excited for a man<<CRLF>>his age, if you ask me!
#00903FI guess you're only as young as you feel,<<CRLF>>huh, Adol?<<CRLF>>
#00900FI'm still kinda worried about him, though,<<CRLF>>so I'm gonna escort him to Promalock.<<CRLF>>
#00900FDon't go doing anything crazy while I'm<<CRLF>>not around, okay?<<CRLF>>
#00904FYou seem to get into trouble the second I<<CRLF>>take my eyes off of you, and I'd rather<<CRLF>>not have to hire a babysitter!
#00901FI don't wanna come back and find that<<CRLF>>you've gotten yourself shipwrecked or<<CRLF>>thrown in jail again, you know?
#00111FWhew...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FWell, I've brought him this far, but what<<CRLF>>am I supposed to do now?<<CRLF>>
#00104FEven when he regains consciousness, he<<CRLF>>probably won't remember a thing.<<CRLF>>
#00105FGuess I should leave him a bit of gold, at<<CRLF>>least...<<CRLF>>
#00109FHmm... Maybe buy him a simple weapon,<<CRLF>>too.<<CRLF>>
#00111FOtherwise he's gonna be in trouble<<CRLF>>when he wakes up, what with all his<<CRLF>>belongings back at that waterfall...
#00109FOh, hey, looks like it's almost time!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FSorry to do this to you, man, but...well,<<CRLF>>I guess he'll be okay here for a little<<CRLF>>while.
#00100F...Hey! You there?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16SYou're LATE!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15101FWhat kind of man keeps a lady waiting<<CRLF>>all this time?!<<CRLF>>
#00111FI couldn't help it, okay? *sigh* Frieda's<<CRLF>>a real slave driver sometimes...<<CRLF>>
#00101FI've got a lot on my hands right now,<<CRLF>>you know!<<CRLF>>
#15100FSo, how is he?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FHe's still unconscious, but he doesn't<<CRLF>>seem to have any major injuries.<<CRLF>>
#00100FI doubt he'll remember anything at all<<CRLF>>when he wakes up, though, so I think<<CRLF>>I'm gonna stay with him for a little while.
#15102FWhaaat?! You don't need to go that far!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15114FDo you realize how long I had to fly<<CRLF>>to get here? Are you really going to<<CRLF>>make me do this every single time?
#00112FW-well, what else am I supposed to do?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAnyway, let Frieda know, would you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15104F...Is that rain?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FDamn... I hope he's okay.<<CRLF>>I'm gonna go check on him.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSee ya!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15102FW-wait a minute!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15112F*sigh* He really is too nice for his own<<CRLF>>good.<<CRLF>>
#15101FIf he'd at least stop trying to be so nice<<CRLF>>to everyone, he might actually get so-<<CRLF>>mewhere with Frieda...
#15108F...Idiot.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp1211.JSON_TEXT 955 >>
...Goodness, life is full of surprises.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
To think that someone would wind up collapsed<<CRLF>>in a heap, in the middle of a bustling city like<<CRLF>>this!
Thank you for helping me.
I don't remember anything...
Well, fortunately I think I have a few spare<<CRLF>>rooms right now.<<CRLF>>
I should be able to give you somewhere to rest,<<CRLF>>at least.<<CRLF>>
So take it easy for a while. That was a nasty<<CRLF>>spill, and I'd hate to see it happen again!<<CRLF>>
Hahaha! Well, aren't you an interesting young<<CRLF>>man.<<CRLF>>
I'm sorry, though, I can't look after you just<<CRLF>>because you say you've lost your memories.<<CRLF>>You'll have to deal with that on your own!
But I should at least be able to give you<<CRLF>>somewhere to rest your weary bones for<<CRLF>>a spell.
So do take it easy. That was a nasty spill, and<<CRLF>>I'd hate to see it happen again!<<CRLF>>
#0152VAdol? Is that you, Adol?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Silver-Haired Man
#00100F#0153V#2MThere you are! I finally found you! It's<<CRLF>>me, your old pal Duren!<<CRLF>>
#00100F#0154V#2MI thought I told you to let me know if<<CRLF>>you managed to make it back alive!<<CRLF>>
Who's Adol?
Who are you?
Silver-Haired Man
#00111F#2MOh boy, that's really not funny.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MIt's you, Adol! Adol Christin!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Silver-Haired Man
#00111F#2MOh boy, that's really not funny.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MEspecially since I just said my name two<<CRLF>>seconds ago. It's Duren, remember?<<CRLF>>
#00100FBut never mind that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103F...I can't believe you came back alive<<CRLF>>from the Great Forest of Celceta, of all<<CRLF>>places!
#00105FThey say when you set foot in there,<<CRLF>>you lose all sense of direction and<<CRLF>>never come out again.
#00105FSupposedly lotsa gold in those woods,<<CRLF>>but Ispani and Romn both keep their dis-<<CRLF>>tance, so there's no map to be found.
#00100FI tried to stop you, man! And once you<<CRLF>>stepped out that gate, I thought you were<<CRLF>>a goner for sure, like all the others.
#00100FBut here you are, proving me wrong!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FYou're my favorite source of mone--<<CRLF>>I mean, my dearest friend!<<CRLF>>
#00100FNow, straight to business. No offense<<CRLF>>intended if I cut to the chase, but<<CRLF>>I am an information dealer, after all!
#00100FI want all the intel you've got about the<<CRLF>>forest, and don't you dare skimp on the<<CRLF>>details!
Tell him the truth
Try winging it
#4CAdol confessed to Duren that he'd lost all his memories.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...What?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00110FCome again?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FYou serious?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAll right, that's what I like to hear!<<CRLF>>First and foremost, then, are there any<<CRLF>>villages in there?
#00100FJust knowing that would be a huge deal<<CRLF>>for future expeditions.<<CRLF>>
#00004F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol couldn't continue the charade. He wound up telling Duren<<CRLF>>the truth.<<CRLF>>
#00109FYou've gotta be kidding me...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FSo you don't even remember who I am?<<CRLF>>Or who YOU are, for that matter?<<CRLF>>
#00105FWhat the hell happened to you in there?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104F...Actually, forget I asked. In fact, forget<<CRLF>>we ever had this conversation at all!<<CRLF>>
#00104FMy instincts are telling me you got<<CRLF>>yourself into some big trouble in that<<CRLF>>forest, and I want no part of it.
#00105FSorry, man. Don't take it personally!<<CRLF>>I just know a bad deal when I hear one.<<CRLF>>
*huff* *huff*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FHey! What's wrong?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#18S...W-we've got a problem!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#18SThe mine...there are monsters<<CRLF>>in the mine!<<CRLF>>
Customers
#16SWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...So monsters just showed up in that<<CRLF>>newly-dug tunnel?<<CRLF>>
It does lead to some old ruin. No surprise<<CRLF>>there'd be monsters in a place like that.<<CRLF>>
Either way, times like these are what we have<<CRLF>>the Romun Army for, right?<<CRLF>>
Oh yeah!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Leo... Where's Commander Leo?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
H-he's not here right now. It seems he's out<<CRLF>>doing some sort of military training exercise.<<CRLF>>
Even worse, the soldiers that are still here<<CRLF>>are just panicking. They have no idea what to<<CRLF>>do!
Seriously?! Man, they really are useless.<<CRLF>>Finally get a chance to do something useful<<CRLF>>for once, and they just freak out!
Are there any miners who didn't get out in<<CRLF>>time?<<CRLF>>
I don't know...it was every man for himself<<CRLF>>in there, so nobody really paid much attention.<<CRLF>>
Can't blame them for that, I guess...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Anyway, we can't just sit around. Let's get<<CRLF>>to the mine!<<CRLF>>
All Present
#16SRight!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FSounds like there's a whole lot of<<CRLF>>trouble down at the old mine.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAdol, I'm gonna go take a look.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSee ya.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00111F*sigh* I think this has been the longest<<CRLF>>day of my life...<<CRLF>>
#00111FSo, what're you gonna do about the<<CRLF>>Governor General's request?<<CRLF>>
I'm going to accept it.
I haven't decided yet.
#00109FHuh, really? That's surprising.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat, you worried?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWell, I don't think you'd get along with<<CRLF>>the Romuns all too well, but...<<CRLF>>
#00105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSay, Adol...I have a crazy idea.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHow about the two of us accept her offer<<CRLF>>together?<<CRLF>>
As partners?
You just want the reward money!
#00100FHey, I said it was a crazy idea!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FIt does kinda feel like I've been dragged<<CRLF>>all over the place by you today, but I<<CRLF>>can't deny it's all been pretty exciting.
#00103FHaha. Is it that obvious?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou're right, of course. But it's not such<<CRLF>>a bad deal for you either, you know!<<CRLF>>
#00100FI want the money, you want to get your<<CRLF>>memories back...<<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd to get your memories back, you're<<CRLF>>gonna need to go back into the Great<<CRLF>>Forest anyway, right?
#00103FWe make the map, sell it to the Romuns,<<CRLF>>and I get some juicy info while we're at<<CRLF>>it. Everybody's happy. It's win-win!
Sounds like a plan.
I feel like I'm being used...
#00100FGreat. It's a deal!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FNothing wrong with being used from time<<CRLF>>to time. Just means you're useful!<<CRLF>>
#00100FIf we can both benefit, we might as<<CRLF>>well stick together. Safer than going<<CRLF>>into those woods alone, that's for sure!
#4CAdol and Duren decided to accept the challenge of mapping the<<CRLF>>Great Forest of Celceta.<<CRLF>>
#4CAs it was late, however, they opted to rest up at the inn for<<CRLF>>their impending expedition.<<CRLF>>
#4CThe next morning, they visited the Governor General to formally<<CRLF>>accept the mission, then immediately began preparing for the road<<CRLF>>ahead.
#00111FAll right... Now, our biggest problem is<<CRLF>>how to get across the river.<<CRLF>>
#00100FIt'd help if we knew whether or not you<<CRLF>>made it across before you lost your<<CRLF>>memories.
#00100FIf so, then we could try duplicating<<CRLF>>whatever it is you did.<<CRLF>>
#00100FIs there anything you've remembered so<<CRLF>>far that might give us something to go<<CRLF>>on?
#4CSelect the most relevant memory.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOf course, that tower!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe haven't seen any towers at all so far.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FCan't say for sure whether or not it's<<CRLF>>in the Primeval Lands, but it certainly<<CRLF>>doesn't seem to be over here...
#00100F...Adol, how does this sound?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FTomorrow, let's go our separate ways and<<CRLF>>see what we can find out.<<CRLF>>
What are you planning?
Are you breaking up with me?
#00100FLike Griselda said, when you're stuck,<<CRLF>>the best thing to do is to go back to the<<CRLF>>drawing board.
#00100FSo I thought I'd go try gathering some<<CRLF>>information.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat is my job, after all.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FDamned straight! We're through, pal!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...is probably what you were expecting<<CRLF>>me to say, huh? But you're dead wrong<<CRLF>>if you think I'd abandon you now.
#00100FI'll admit that at first, I was getting awful<<CRLF>>sick of your goody-two-shoes attitude.<<CRLF>>
#00100FBut we've come this far together, so I'm<<CRLF>>sticking around till the bitter end. Or at<<CRLF>>least until we get all that reward money!
#00100FI'll start out by checking all my usual<<CRLF>>sources.<<CRLF>>
#00100FI might learn something we can use.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHow about you? Any ideas?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll gather information too.
I'll just laze around in bed.
#00100FI'll drink to that! See if you can beat<<CRLF>>me at my own game, as it were!<<CRLF>>
#00100FThings have changed in Casnan since<<CRLF>>we first started working on the map, so<<CRLF>>there're bound to be some leads.
#00103FThat sounds like a great idea! Everyone<<CRLF>>needs a good rest once in a while...<<CRLF>>
#00101F...except now, you lazy slob! You're<<CRLF>>gonna get out into the city and gather<<CRLF>>intelligence yourself, or so help me...
#00111F...Rrg! You were the one who dragged<<CRLF>>me into this mess, so no staying in bed<<CRLF>>while I work my ass off, and that's that!
#00100FIt's settled, then! Starting tomorrow, we<<CRLF>>each go our separate ways and see<<CRLF>>what we can dig up.
#00103FBut for now, it's time to go get us some<<CRLF>>sleep. We need to be well-rested for the<<CRLF>>'hunt'...
#00100FHey. You seem pretty awake and alert.<<CRLF>>That's good!<<CRLF>>
#00100FI guess this is goodbye for now, then. <<CRLF>>We'll meet up again later to see what<<CRLF>>we've got.
#00100FFirst things first, I'll be heading off to see<<CRLF>>an old friend.<<CRLF>>
An old friend?
It's going to be lonely without you.
#00104FY-yeah, an old friend in the same trade.<<CRLF>>We don't exactly mix that well, but I can't<<CRLF>>really afford to be picky right now.
#00100FThis could take all day, as I'll be heading<<CRLF>>out of the city.<<CRLF>>
#00111FReally? I didn't peg you the lonely sort.<<CRLF>>I can even kind of see you as a hermit...<<CRLF>>Either way, though, I won't be gone long.
#00100FI'll meet you back here tonight.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FIf you're hard up for ideas, how about<<CRLF>>doing some of the quests off the inn's<<CRLF>>quest board?
#00100FYou're kind of a hero to the people here,<<CRLF>>so I'm sure they'd be pretty happy.<<CRLF>>
#00103FAnd if you're doing nice things for the<<CRLF>>locals, then info will flow easier than<<CRLF>>pouring wine out of a bottle!
#00100FOops, I've stretched this out way too<<CRLF>>long as it is. See you again tonight!<<CRLF>>Take care!
#4CThere appear to be two new quests on the quest board.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CBoth of them are marked as urgent. Perhaps it would be best to<<CRLF>>complete them before the end of the day.<<CRLF>>
#0MThis place is huge! I couldn't believe it when<<CRLF>>I got here.<<CRLF>>
#0MAnd the houses are all made out of stone...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's nothing special...
What were you doing up there?
#00203FNo, it really is!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI know you told me about it in Comodo,<<CRLF>>but I didn't think it would be THIS different<<CRLF>>here.
#00203FThis town is so big, I didn't know where<<CRLF>>I was going...<<CRLF>>
#00200FI thought the best thing to do was to<<CRLF>>head for the tallest, most central building<<CRLF>>I could find.
#00200FI'd never see you with so many people<<CRLF>>around, so my best bet for spotting you<<CRLF>>was to climb as high up as possible.
#00203FI had no idea I wasn't supposed to be up<<CRLF>>there... I'm sorry, okay?<<CRLF>>
Don't worry about it.
Not like I can talk.
#00203FHeheh, thanks.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FBut you wound up getting in trouble for<<CRLF>>what I did, so I really am sorry.<<CRLF>>
#00200FI just can't believe how different the<<CRLF>>world is outside Comodo...<<CRLF>>
#00203FHeheh, I guess you really can't!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FYou didn't listen to anything we told you<<CRLF>>when you came to Comodo either.<<CRLF>>
#00200FBut I can't believe how different the<<CRLF>>world is outside Comodo...<<CRLF>>
#00200FI think I understand how you must have<<CRLF>>felt now. At least...a little bit.<<CRLF>>
You came all this way on your own?
Can't believe you escaped the forest.
#00203FYep! Aren't I amazing?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FI knew you'd be surprised!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FWell, the little bits you told me about the<<CRLF>>route you took to Comodo definitely helped.<<CRLF>>
#00200FIf not for that, I'd still probably be<<CRLF>>wandering aimlessly out there somewhere.<<CRLF>>
#00200FBesides, no one's better than me at<<CRLF>>sneaking around the forest unnoticed!<<CRLF>>
#00200FI've come up with all kinds of stealth<<CRLF>>techniques to make sure none of the<<CRLF>>men are better at hunting than me.
Why did you come all this way?
What happened after we left?
#00200FActually, I wanted to ask you a favor...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FSee, I've...done a lot of thinking.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FI was pretty shocked to hear that Remnos<<CRLF>>had kept his strength a secret from me.<<CRLF>>
#00204FBut I still haven't heard a peep about it<<CRLF>>from Remnos himself.<<CRLF>>
#00200FAll I know is what Father and that woman<<CRLF>>told me.<<CRLF>>
#00201FSo I decided...that I want to go find him<<CRLF>>myself. And ask him what his deal is.<<CRLF>>
What will you do then?
How do you intend to find him?
#00203FIsn't it obvious?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FFirst, I'll take him back from that woman.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FThen, if everything she and Father said is<<CRLF>>true, I'll slap him!<<CRLF>>
#00200FWell, I'll search as much of the forest as<<CRLF>>I can, for starters.<<CRLF>>
#00204FLike I said back in Comodo, I'm no good<<CRLF>>at sitting around and planning. I'm a doer,<<CRLF>>not a thinker.
#00201FSo right now I'm gonna find Remnos and<<CRLF>>talk with him. And if everything I've heard<<CRLF>>is true, I'm gonna slap him!
#00205FI mean, it's pretty rude when you think<<CRLF>>about it...<<CRLF>>
#00201FYou can't just...decide you're better than<<CRLF>>someone and hold back on their account.<<CRLF>>
#00201FThat's not fair to me at all. In fact, it<<CRLF>>really hurts!<<CRLF>>
#00203F...But then after I slap him a few times,<<CRLF>>I'll hug him reeeeally tightly.<<CRLF>>
#00203FAnd thank him for this experience. So<<CRLF>>he'd better be ready for me...or else!<<CRLF>>
Perfect answer.
That's very you, Karna.
#00203FHeh. Don't I know it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FHeh. I'll take that as a compliment!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI asked Father about it, and he said I<<CRLF>>could go as long as I traveled with you.<<CRLF>>
#00201FSo...will you take me with you? Please?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I suppose I don't have a choice.
We'd be more than happy to have you.
#00203FR-really? Phew... I didn't know what to<<CRLF>>do if you said no.<<CRLF>>
#00200FStill, I don't want to get in the way of<<CRLF>>you getting your memories back.<<CRLF>>
#00203FReally? You're not just saying that so I'll<<CRLF>>feel better?<<CRLF>>
#00200FI don't want you worrying about me when<<CRLF>>you need to be focused on getting your<<CRLF>>memories back.
#00200FI'll just be tagging along for the ride.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200F...Still...thanks, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FThey serve food and drink here, right?<<CRLF>>We should have a toast!<<CRLF>>
#00200FHeheh. Well, then...to our reunion!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FAnd to getting your memories back, and<<CRLF>>to reuniting with Remnos...<<CRLF>>
#00203F#16SCheers!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206F*gulp* *gulp*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206F*slurp* *chomp*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FAaahh... That was wonderful! I've never<<CRLF>>tasted anything like that before.<<CRLF>>
#00203F#3WOh yeah...where did...Duren...go...<<CRLF>>anyway...<<CRLF>>
#00203F#3W...Huh? My head feels...all...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206F#3W...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206F#3WZzz...Zzz...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CKarna fell asleep almost instantaneously.<<CRLF>>She must have been exhausted!<<CRLF>>
#00103FDa da da daaa, da, da, da, dada! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI'm back! Hope you haven't been waiting<<CRLF>>long, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00109F...Huh, wasn't expecting to find Karna<<CRLF>>here.<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhy is she asleep?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FYou...you didn't...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I almost got away with it, too.
How can you even think that?!
#00111F...Your sense of humor really scares me<<CRLF>>sometimes.<<CRLF>>
#00105FThought so. It's just juice. She must've<<CRLF>>been dead tired.<<CRLF>>
#00103FHey, you gotta admit, it looks pretty bad!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FThought so. It's just juice. She must've<<CRLF>>been dead tired.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, we can't leave her here like this.<<CRLF>>Give me a hand carrying her to one of<<CRLF>>the rooms.
#00100F...What're you staring into space for?<<CRLF>>Come on, this is a job for her prince!<<CRLF>>
#00109F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FAdol, look at her legs.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FNo, no, not like that, you pervert!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CKarna's legs were all cut up, and her shoes looked<<CRLF>>really worn.<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhoa, and check out the soles of her<<CRLF>>shoes. Completely ruined!<<CRLF>>
#00101FShe must've gone through a lot to get<<CRLF>>here.<<CRLF>>
#00206F#3WMm...mm...Remnos... Wait for...me...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206F#3WI'll bring...you home...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol and Duren carried the exhausted Karna to a room,<<CRLF>>leaving her to rest.<<CRLF>>
#00105F...I see. I figured she'd probably go after<<CRLF>>Remnos.<<CRLF>>
#00100FBut I didn't think she'd come all this way<<CRLF>>through the forest on her own!<<CRLF>>
#00100FNow, time to get down to business.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Did you learn anything?
Did you meet your friend?
#00100FYeah, I think so.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, actually...I'll let you answer that for<<CRLF>>yourself after you see this.<<CRLF>>
#00110FHuh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FAnd thanks to that, I managed to get my<<CRLF>>hands on this.<<CRLF>>
#00101FDo you recognize it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CDuren produced a well-worn notebook.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FManaged to get my hands on this from...<<CRLF>>well, let's just call that a trade secret.<<CRLF>>
#00100FIt's full of information about the Great<<CRLF>>Forest. Which is surprising in and of<<CRLF>>itself.
#00100FBut look at this bit. Right here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThere's an image that appears to be a hand-drawn map of the<<CRLF>>Great Forest with notes scrawled all over it.<<CRLF>>
#4CThe handwriting looks somewhat familiar...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MI have no idea what this pattern of<<CRLF>>diamonds on the left page is all about.<<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MBut look at the map on the right page.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe words 'Primeval Lands' are written at the top.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104F#2MAnd look at this bit in the middle.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CDuren pointed to the word 'Tower.'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Is this...?
Whose is this?
#00100F#2MI don't think there's any doubt about it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MThis was yours before you lost your<<CRLF>>memories.<<CRLF>>
#00109F#2M...Are you playing dumb on purpose?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MThis was yours before you lost your<<CRLF>>memories.<<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MNot a bad find, huh? See, the information<<CRLF>>game isn't all about rumors and hearsay,<<CRLF>>but items like this, too!
#00100F#2MSeems pretty likely you dropped this right<<CRLF>>around when you got hit with...whatever it<<CRLF>>is that wiped your memory clean.
#00100F#2MAnd it sure looks to me like after visiting<<CRLF>>Comodo and Selray, you crossed over to<<CRLF>>the Primeval Lands...
#00101F#2MBut what's most important to us right<<CRLF>>now is this bit here, right on the river:<<CRLF>>
#00101F#2MLooks like there might be a passage in<<CRLF>>an underground ruin.<<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MBarely a stone's throw away from Selray.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MYou must've gone through there and come<<CRLF>>out on the other side of the river.<<CRLF>>
You're amazing, Duren!
Let's go check it out!
#00103F...W-well, yeah, I guess I am! I did go<<CRLF>>through a hell of a lot of trouble to get this,<<CRLF>>after all.
#00111FNow hold up a minute! I get that you're<<CRLF>>excited, but it's the middle of the night...<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's get some rest first, and set out in<<CRLF>>the morning.<<CRLF>>
#00100FBesides, Karna's coming with us, isn't<<CRLF>>she? And she needs her rest even more<<CRLF>>than we do!
#00200FSo we're heading to Selray first?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI did hear about a village near the river<<CRLF>>from my father.<<CRLF>>
#00203FBut this will be my first time actually<<CRLF>>going there.<<CRLF>>
#00100FShould probably meet with Ozma, too,<<CRLF>>and see if he knows anything about this<<CRLF>>underground ruin.
#00100FAll right, Adol. Soon as you're ready, let's<<CRLF>>hit the road!<<CRLF>>
Hmm... That look on your face tells me that you<<CRLF>>have something to say. Could you have seen my<<CRLF>>request on the board?
#00100FThat's right. So, what is it you want us<<CRLF>>to do?<<CRLF>>
Allow me to explain.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Right now, I'm in the middle of refining my<<CRLF>>finest product.<<CRLF>>
Naturally, I'm talking about the almighty Muscle<<CRLF>>Milkshake.<<CRLF>>
After some thought, I've decided on the<<CRLF>>perfect ingredient.<<CRLF>>
The essence of the wild, impossible to obtain<<CRLF>>from livestock raised surrounded by domestic<<CRLF>>comforts.
...That, gentlemen, is Fabros Milk.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FFabros Milk?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Indeed! The fabros is a strong, wild beast<<CRLF>>which looks similar to a cow, found on the<<CRLF>>plains just before the Great Forest.
And I'd like you two to go and milk one for me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FMilking a wild beast, huh? This sounds<<CRLF>>like it's gonna be a tough one.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo, is there some way to tell the males<<CRLF>>and the females apart?<<CRLF>>
#00100FSeeing as we'll obviously have to milk a<<CRLF>>female...<<CRLF>>
The easiest way to tell them apart is to look<<CRLF>>at the horns.<<CRLF>>
Males have three horns, while the females only<<CRLF>>have one.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat easy, huh? All right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There are also a few other things you should<<CRLF>>bear in mind.<<CRLF>>
The first is that female fabroses are<<CRLF>>exceptionally cautious beasts.<<CRLF>>
As such, you won't find many of them on the<<CRLF>>plains.<<CRLF>>
And if one of them sees a threat, it will run<<CRLF>>away immediately.<<CRLF>>
So you're going to have to sneak up on it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FYou're really pretty knowledgeable about<<CRLF>>these things, aren't you?<<CRLF>>
Haha, but of course! In my younger days, I<<CRLF>>would sometimes milk a fabros and drink it on<<CRLF>>the spot.
But I can't abandon this shop long enough to<<CRLF>>do that now.<<CRLF>>
All I can do is put out a request asking<<CRLF>>someone else to do it for me.<<CRLF>>
#00100FRight.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FI think that covers everything.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou got all that, Adol? Next time we're<<CRLF>>out on the plains, let's look for a female<<CRLF>>fabros.
Actually, I have a fairly good idea where you<<CRLF>>can find one. There's a patch of field where<<CRLF>>the fabroses are known to graze.
Here, let me show you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CMucho pointed to an area on the map of the Great Forest.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe spot where female fabroses are known to\ngraze has now been marked!
Well, then, good luck to you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hrnnng...<<CRLF>>I AM A MAAAYUN!!<<CRLF>>
Hmm... I see you were able to milk a fabros.<<CRLF>>Excellent!<<CRLF>>
#00100FYep. And it's fresh, too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Then I must taste it right away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This unique, punchy taste...<<CRLF>>How I've missed it!<<CRLF>>
I'm going to try to make my new drink right<<CRLF>>away!<<CRLF>>
Behold. The Fabros Milkshake.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Gentlemen...<<CRLF>>A toast to its successful completion!<<CRLF>>
#00103FSure, why not?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol, Duren and Mucho held their glasses together and drank the<<CRLF>>Fabros Milkshake.<<CRLF>>
#00104FThis is...well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Admit it tastes disgusting
Tell him it tastes wonderful
You're right. This isn't very good at all.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There's no need to lie, now.<<CRLF>>You won't hurt my feelings.<<CRLF>>
This is, quite frankly, rather revolting.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FIt's certainly...unique, I'll give you that,<<CRLF>>but...<<CRLF>>
#00111FThat gamey tang really gets stuck in your<<CRLF>>nose.<<CRLF>>
Mmm. Couldn't have said it better myself.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't know what went wrong. The recipe<<CRLF>>seemed perfect!<<CRLF>>
...Either way, I still need to thank the two of<<CRLF>>you for going to the trouble of getting the milk<<CRLF>>for me.
Here's the reward I promised.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd...don't give up. You'll get it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha, but of course!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This is nothing. I recover from missteps like<<CRLF>>this all the time, and at record speed!<<CRLF>>
Hrnnng...<<CRLF>>I AM A MAAAYUN!!<<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'To Milk a Fabros'!
#00400FExcuse me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm? What is it, young lady?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Can I help you with something?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FActually, we're currently working on a<<CRLF>>quest for another village.<<CRLF>>
#00400FAnd I was wondering if you might tell me<<CRLF>>your name.<<CRLF>>
Sure, I guess.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My name is Quincy.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FBingo! We found someone!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FCould I ask you to sign this notebook for<<CRLF>>me, please?<<CRLF>>
S-sign? Like, an autograph?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
O-of course, it would be my pleasure!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm so glad I practiced in case something like<<CRLF>>this ever happened!<<CRLF>>
#4CFilled the 'Q' page of the Signature Book!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FThat's perfect.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FThank you very much.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, it was nothing, I'm honored to have been<<CRLF>>able to help!<<CRLF>>
If you ever need anything else, Quincy's always<<CRLF>>here to help! Hahaha!<<CRLF>>
#4CFilled all the pages of the notebook!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CFound all of the hidden gold ore!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You must be...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The brave warriors of the Great Forest who've<<CRLF>>come from afar to fulfill my request, no?<<CRLF>>
#00111FNo, that doesn't really sound like us...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. I'm sorry. I might have exaggerated a<<CRLF>>little.<<CRLF>>
You saw my request on the board, correct?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FHeh. That sounds about right, yeah.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FCan you give us some more details?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'd be happy to.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm sure you remember helping me get some<<CRLF>>Fabros Milk a while ago.<<CRLF>>
Ever since then, I've been wondering endlessly<<CRLF>>how I could turn the powerful wild taste of that<<CRLF>>milk into something more...palatable.
And I think I've finally found the answer.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It lies in the existence of the Roda Tree!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FO-okay. Not sure I follow you, but...go<<CRLF>>on.<<CRLF>>
My interest lies in the Roda Tree's purifying<<CRLF>>capabilities.<<CRLF>>
From what I've heard, the Roda Tree uses its<<CRLF>>leaves to absorb poison and turns it into<<CRLF>>fruits of energy.
And it's that function which makes Roda Leaves<<CRLF>>the perfect ingredient to complement the Fabros<<CRLF>>Milk.
If I had a Roda leaf, I could bring out the true<<CRLF>>shining potential of the Fabros Milk...or so I<<CRLF>>believe.
#00100FSo, basically, you want us to go and get<<CRLF>>you a Roda Leaf?<<CRLF>>
Precisely.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Would you be willing to do that for me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FWell...we can try.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FStill, don't get your hopes up! What<<CRLF>>you're asking for isn't found anywhere<<CRLF>>near here, so this won't be easy.
Hmm... Somehow, despite your disclaimer, I feel<<CRLF>>I can count on you to bring me what I seek.<<CRLF>>
Either way, you're my best hope, so I leave<<CRLF>>this matter in your hands.<<CRLF>>
Hrnnng...<<CRLF>>I AM A MAAAYUN!!<<CRLF>>
I see you've brought the Roda Leaf that I<<CRLF>>asked for.<<CRLF>>
#00100FYep, here it is!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... This vivid green color... These powerful<<CRLF>>veins...<<CRLF>>
*sniff* *sniff*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And this fresh, striking fragrance...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This is it! This is truly the ultimate ingredient!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And with it, I can now create the ultimate<<CRLF>>muscle drink, at long last!<<CRLF>>
Behold the masterpiece! My greatest creation!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I shall name it...the Fabros Milkshake MAX!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FThat's great and all, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAre we going to have to drink it again?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... Well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There were only enough ingredients for me to<<CRLF>>make this one drink.<<CRLF>>
And its true value can only be fully<<CRLF>>appreciated when you drink it in one go.<<CRLF>>
So...how about you choose one of your<<CRLF>>companions to chug it down?<<CRLF>>
#00100FErm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FOkay. Who gets to pull the trigger, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll drink it myself.
You can drink it, Duren.
Karna can drink it.
Ozma can drink it.
Calilica can drink it.
Frieda can drink it.
#4CAdol took the Fabros Milkshake MAX from Mucho and drank it in<<CRLF>>one gulp.<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol felt power surging throughout his body.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol's maximum HP increased by 300!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So, how was it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Actually...delicious!
Absolutely divine!
Truly? That's wonderful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWow, doesn't look like you're lying,<<CRLF>>either.<<CRLF>>
#00111FWhy couldn't I have drunk it this time<<CRLF>>instead of last time? Nothing ventured,<<CRLF>>nothing gained, I guess...
#4CDuren took the Fabros Milkshake MAX from Mucho and drank it in<<CRLF>>one gulp.<<CRLF>>
#4CDuren felt power surging throughout his body.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CDuren's maximum HP increased by 300!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So, how was it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FMan, that was actually really good!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FI'd pay good money to drink that again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Really? That's wonderful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol summoned Karna to the bar.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CKarna took the Fabros Milkshake MAX from Mucho and drank it in<<CRLF>>one gulp.<<CRLF>>
#4CKarna felt power surging throughout her body.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CKarna's maximum HP increased by 300!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So, how was it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206FReally good, actually!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FI could drink that all day. <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Really? That's wonderful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol summoned Ozma to the bar.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4COzma took the Fabros Milkshake MAX from Mucho and drank it in<<CRLF>>one gulp.<<CRLF>>
#4COzma felt power surging throughout his body.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4COzma's maximum HP increased by 300!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So, how was it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FIt was...surprisingly delicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FI would be happy to drink it again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Really? That's wonderful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol summoned Calilica to the bar.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CCalilica took the Fabros Milkshake MAX from Mucho and drank it in<<CRLF>>one gulp.<<CRLF>>
#4CCalilica felt power surging throughout her body.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CCalilica's maximum HP increased by 300!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So, how was it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FMan, how do I even put it? It was...<<CRLF>>sublime.<<CRLF>>
#00403FI'd love to drink another one sometime!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Really? That's wonderful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol summoned Frieda to the bar.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CFrieda took the Fabros Milkshake MAX from Mucho and drank it in<<CRLF>>one gulp.<<CRLF>>
#4CFrieda felt power surging throughout her body.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CFrieda's maximum HP increased by 300!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So, how was it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FI think 'delicious' is the only word that<<CRLF>>seems appropriate.<<CRLF>>
#00510FIf this were a regular menu item, I would<<CRLF>>order it every time.<<CRLF>>
Really? That's wonderful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If I can gather all of the ingredients again,<<CRLF>>then I can... Ah...<<CRLF>>
#18S...N-NOOOOOO!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWh-what's wrong?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I...I forgot to write down the recipe!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That drink was created through a delicately<<CRLF>>measured, harmonious balance that bordered on<<CRLF>>the miraculous...
I fear I'll never be able to make another.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Still, I should thank you for bringing me<<CRLF>>the exceptionally rare ingredient I requested.<<CRLF>>
Here's the reward I promised.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FThanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd don't give up. Seriously.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha, but of course!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This is nothing compared to the power of muscle<<CRLF>>memory. As long as I've got these guns, I can<<CRLF>>easily 'remember' what I did!
Hrnnng...<<CRLF>>I AM A MAAAYUN!!<<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'The Ultimate Purifier'!
#00100FNow, I'm sure you're ready to explore,<<CRLF>>but let me first give you a rundown of<<CRLF>>the things you can do in Casnan.
#00100FFirst, quests! Here's how they work.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FYou can accept quests whenever you<<CRLF>>want by checking the quest board in the<<CRLF>>inn.
#00100FAnd every time you complete a quest,<<CRLF>>you'll get a reward from the client.<<CRLF>>
#00100FYou see that board over there? That's<<CRLF>>Casnan's quest board.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's go have a closer look at it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FDid you check everything posted<<CRLF>>there?<<CRLF>>
#00100FHey, it looks like someone from this bar's<<CRLF>>put a request up.<<CRLF>>
#00111F...Convenient, I guess. If you feel like<<CRLF>>accepting it, go talk to him. Might be good<<CRLF>>practice. Though this guy's a little...odd...
#00100FBy the way, you have a journal, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FYou can note your progress exploring the<<CRLF>>Great Forest, quests you've accepted,<<CRLF>>monsters encountered, materials found...
#00100FIf you write those kinds of things down,<<CRLF>>it'll come in handy later on. It's always a<<CRLF>>good idea to take lots of notes!
#00100FThat's all I've got to say about quests.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FNext, I'll give you a quick tour around<<CRLF>>town, so let's head outside.<<CRLF>>
#00100FRight. Did you check everything on the<<CRLF>>quest board?<<CRLF>>
#00111FCome on, Adol, I'm not asking for the<<CRLF>>world here, so don't try and cheat.<<CRLF>>
#00111FGo on! Check it out!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FNice place, isn't it? That guy over there<<CRLF>>is its namesake, Thomas.<<CRLF>>
#00100FIf you want to buy any weapons or<<CRLF>>armor, he's the man to talk to.<<CRLF>>
#00100FNext, I'll show you around the trading<<CRLF>>post.<<CRLF>>
#00100FYou can enter the trading post directly<<CRLF>>from outside, or you can go the back<<CRLF>>way through the armory.
#00100FSince we're here already, it's faster just<<CRLF>>to go down the stairs. Come on.<<CRLF>>
#4CIt would be best to check the quests displayed on the board<<CRLF>>before leaving.<<CRLF>>
#00100FCome on, check the quest board first.<<CRLF>>We can go back outside after that.<<CRLF>>
#00100FHold on. You can get to the trading post<<CRLF>>faster by going down the stairs. No need<<CRLF>>to go around from outside.
#00100FThe staircase is in the back of the shop.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

I wish the Romuns would tell us what's going on<<CRLF>>in the Great Forest already. We haven't heard<<CRLF>>anything in ages.
It's really frustrating. I can smell a chance<<CRLF>>for business, but I can't do a thing about it.<<CRLF>>
This town's as profitable as ever on its own,<<CRLF>>but all those stories of the army finding a new<<CRLF>>gold vein? Pure poppycock, if you ask me.
Plenty of rumors, but no one knows anything for<<CRLF>>sure. I wish the Governor General would make<<CRLF>>things clear one way or the other already.
Lately, the Celcetan Army seems to be making<<CRLF>>expeditions into and out from the Great Forest<<CRLF>>like it's going out of style.
I'm really curious to know if they've found<<CRLF>>something big.<<CRLF>>
I see Governor General Griselda in town from<<CRLF>>time to time, but she always seems really busy.<<CRLF>>
I'll bet she's the kind of woman who'll miss her<<CRLF>>chance to get married. In fact, she's probably<<CRLF>>already missed it!
You got enough potions?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You can never have enough potions. You never<<CRLF>>know when you'll need them.<<CRLF>>
I guess the Romun Army's arrival means the<<CRLF>>Romuns are finally ready to give their all<<CRLF>>to exploring the Great Forest.
As a resident of Celceta, I can't say I'm happy<<CRLF>>to have them skulking around here...but, there's<<CRLF>>profit to be made, so I can't be too sore.
I suppose I can only pray they find another gold<<CRLF>>vein.<<CRLF>>

Considering how great the economic climate is<<CRLF>>right now, I'm really worried about what's<<CRLF>>coming later. Inevitably...it's going to crash.
I don't want to think about it, but this gold<<CRLF>>rush is bound to come to an end one day.<<CRLF>>

Hand over Roda Leaf

I'll be waiting right here, so be sure and come<<CRLF>>see me if you manage to track down that Roda<<CRLF>>Leaf I asked for.
Hrnnng...<<CRLF>>I AM A MAAAYUN!!<<CRLF>>
Hmm... So you haven't been able to find a Roda<<CRLF>>Leaf yet?<<CRLF>>
Well, I'll be waiting right here as always,<<CRLF>>so if you do come across one, you know where<<CRLF>>to find me.
Hrnnng...<<CRLF>>I AM A MAAAYUN!!<<CRLF>>
I'll be waiting here, so be sure you come let me<<CRLF>>know once you finish milking that fabros, okay?<<CRLF>>
Hrnnng...<<CRLF>>I AM A MAAAYUN!!<<CRLF>>
It seems Fabros Milk is a stronger adversary<<CRLF>>than I had anticipated.<<CRLF>>
But this is nothing. I will recover from this<<CRLF>>minor setback and challenge it again another<<CRLF>>day!
Hrnnng...<<CRLF>>I AM A MAAAYUN!!<<CRLF>>
I need something powerful enough to counter-<<CRLF>>balance the overwhelming taste of the Fabros<<CRLF>>Milk.
But what could possibly accomplish such a<<CRLF>>daunting task? I must find it!<<CRLF>>
Hrnnng...<<CRLF>>I AM A MAAAYUN!!<<CRLF>>
I might not have written down the miraculous<<CRLF>>balance of ingredients that allowed me to create<<CRLF>>the Fabros Milkshake MAX...

#3CCompleted the quest 'Fruit Bat in the Dark'!
Oh, are you here about Langritz?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This request actually came from the Governor<<CRLF>>General's office.<<CRLF>>
It's too dangerous to leave that thing alone<<CRLF>>for too long, so we've been sent reward money<<CRLF>>in advance to give to whoever defeats it.
So let me know if you happen to be the one!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This money's got your name on it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, are you here about Olrabadi?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Reports have said it's established itself in<<CRLF>>the part of the mine where that monster first<<CRLF>>appeared.
The miners are getting really nervous, so the<<CRLF>>sooner someone can defeat it, the better.<<CRLF>>
I tried talking to my dad about Brian, but he<<CRLF>>told me to leave him be.<<CRLF>>
It's not my place to interfere with a man's<<CRLF>>journey to muscular perfection...apparently.<<CRLF>>
But I suppose it's a bit late to be saying<<CRLF>>anything now anyway.<<CRLF>>
And it's not like I'm not...kinda into that<<CRLF>>passionate dedication. Heh.<<CRLF>>
In fact, if he actually manages to win against<<CRLF>>Dad, I might even fall for him!<<CRLF>>
...Not that I honestly think he has a chance of<<CRLF>>winning.<<CRLF>>
Dad established the arm-wrestling rule because<<CRLF>>customers kept hitting on me faster than he<<CRLF>>could keep track of them.
Thanks to that, there have been far fewer men<<CRLF>>trying, but...<<CRLF>>
I can't help feeling a little torn. Especially<<CRLF>>about Brian.<<CRLF>>
I'm flattered by his feelings, but resting this<<CRLF>>kind of decision on the results of an arm-<<CRLF>>wrestling match is just...you know?
And it's not as if he'll ever be able to beat<<CRLF>>my dad...but that's my dad! What am I supposed<<CRLF>>to say to him?
I hope Brian is okay. It can't be healthy to<<CRLF>>guzzle drinks like that.<<CRLF>>
Kind of has me a bit worried!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* Dad is really far too overprotective.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Someone who's got the kind of build you'd need<<CRLF>>in order to win against dad really isn't going<<CRLF>>to be my type anyway.
Hmm. Guess it wasn't just my imagination<<CRLF>>after all.<<CRLF>>
But that's fine! I don't mind being watched. <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heh. It might be my imagination, but I feel<<CRLF>>like someone's watching me.<<CRLF>>
...Which has me a bit worried, to be honest. Not<<CRLF>>for myself, but for the watcher! If Dad notices,<<CRLF>>there's going to be quite a scuffle...
I'm sure you can tell just by looking at the<<CRLF>>quest board, but some requests have to be<<CRLF>>completed within a certain time limit.
If you leave them too long, they might not<<CRLF>>be there anymore next time you look, so I'd<<CRLF>>recommend finishing them as soon as possible.
Good morning Adol. Did you have a good night's<<CRLF>>sleep?<<CRLF>>
You really did a fine job yesterday.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

I just thought of something. Winning against<<CRLF>>the owner only earns me the right to date<<CRLF>>Luluca.
So even if I somehow manage to beat that mass<<CRLF>>of muscles, there's no guarantee she's going to<<CRLF>>be interested in me.

*gulp* *gulp* Aaaah!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The owner's Muscle Milkshakes aren't the easiest<<CRLF>>things to drink, but I've gotten used to them.<<CRLF>>They have quite an...unusual taste.
I'll deal with the foulest flavors of them all,<<CRLF>>though, if it's for Luluca!<<CRLF>>
All right, a short break and then it's time for<<CRLF>>another!<<CRLF>>
Hahaha... I'm going to do it. I'm really going<<CRLF>>to do it!<<CRLF>>
The owner of this bar has established a rule for<<CRLF>>dating Luluca.<<CRLF>>
Basically, all I gotta do is beat him at arm-<<CRLF>>wrestling.<<CRLF>>
Soldiers of the Great Forest, I honor the<<CRLF>>challenge in your hearts.<<CRLF>>
But I'm not going to rush this. No, I'm not<<CRLF>>going to rush at all.<<CRLF>>
I'll spend today drinking Muscle Milkshakes<<CRLF>>like I always do.<<CRLF>>
Are they...are they seriously thinking of trying<<CRLF>>to talk to Luluca?!<<CRLF>>
*gulp* Those are some truly fearless men.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Apparently, those soldiers over there were sent<<CRLF>>here from Romn.<<CRLF>>
...But more importantly, they keep staring at<<CRLF>>Luluca.<<CRLF>>
I'm a regular customer in here and even I'm<<CRLF>>not allowed to stare at her like that. It's not fair,<<CRLF>>I tell you!

I'm sure you've seen those soldiers standing<<CRLF>>around town looking like they have all the free<<CRLF>>time in the world.
They actually get paid for doing that! Doesn't<<CRLF>>it make you horribly jealous?<<CRLF>>
Enlisting in the army...is something to<<CRLF>>consider.<<CRLF>>
Though when I think of the possibility that<<CRLF>>I might actually be sent into battle one day,<<CRLF>>it suddenly doesn't seem like such a good idea.
Oh, Luluca, you look just as stunning today as<<CRLF>>ever.<<CRLF>>
If it wasn't for that loathsome rule, I'd be<<CRLF>>able to get closer to her...<<CRLF>>
There are all kinds of rumors about the Primeval<<CRLF>>Lands on the other side of the river, but no one<<CRLF>>seems to know the truth.
I wonder what it's really like over there...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The cliff beyond the river is so dangerous, many<<CRLF>>have given up even trying to cross it.<<CRLF>>
I feel as if the army has definitely worked<<CRLF>>out something regarding the Primeval Lands.<<CRLF>>
But every time I ask the soldiers, they<<CRLF>>always just talk in circles. It's extremely<<CRLF>>frustrating.
Aaah, nothing calms you down like a good<<CRLF>>coffee.<<CRLF>>
Long as it's got lots of milk and sugar,<<CRLF>>that is!<<CRLF>>
Just because my name's Black doesn't mean<<CRLF>>I have to take my coffee black. People always<<CRLF>>assume that!
...Huh? There's something...strange about this<<CRLF>>milk.<<CRLF>>
...That damned bar owner, is he experimenting<<CRLF>>with weird beast milk again?<<CRLF>>
I haven't got all the details yet, but the army<<CRLF>>seems to have discovered something major near<<CRLF>>the river in the Great Forest.
Apparently it's some kind of ruin. They've<<CRLF>>sealed off the entrance and won't let any<<CRLF>>explorers or prospectors get near it.
I wonder what's in there...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There's nothing unusual about finding a ruin in<<CRLF>>the Great Forest, but they wouldn't normally<<CRLF>>seal off the entrance.
I wonder what they found...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It seems a number of other explorers have<<CRLF>>reached Comodo and Selray too, though they're<<CRLF>>still quite a ways behind you on the map.
I'd love to see inside the Great Forest with<<CRLF>>my own eyes instead of just hearing stories<<CRLF>>about it...
But a lot of people have either been injured<<CRLF>>or collapsed in the forest.<<CRLF>>
I don't think I'm brave enough to risk that<<CRLF>>kind of danger!<<CRLF>>
We're gradually starting to find out more about<<CRLF>>the Great Forest, but the number who've been<<CRLF>>injured or collapsed in there keeps rising.
I don't think I'm brave enough to risk that<<CRLF>>kind of danger!<<CRLF>>
That officer who came in with the Romun Army,<<CRLF>>Gruda, is a rather mysterious man.<<CRLF>>
I tried finding out more about his background,<<CRLF>>but there's so little information on him,<<CRLF>>I didn't learn a thing.
Duren's relatively new to the business, but he's<<CRLF>>not a bad information dealer at all.<<CRLF>>
I don't know where he came from originally...<<CRLF>>but, well, us information dealers are mostly<<CRLF>>a secretive bunch.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that you're<<CRLF>>lucky to get paired up with him.<<CRLF>>
So don't you let him get away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Duren's relatively new to the business, but he's<<CRLF>>not a bad information dealer at all.<<CRLF>>
So don't you let him get away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ruins and treasure from what appears to be an<<CRLF>>ancient civilization are often found here, but<<CRLF>>no one knows exactly where they came from.
No surprise, considering how dangerous the Great<<CRLF>>Forest is. Many who went in there to study them<<CRLF>>in greater detail never came back out...
A boy who's lost his memories and a suspicious<<CRLF>>information dealer... What a pair you two are!<<CRLF>>
And just who are you?
We're not here to kill you.
The name's Black. I'm an information dealer<<CRLF>>who's worked in this town for quite some time.<<CRLF>>
#00111FI know that's a true statement, but when<<CRLF>>you just blurt it out unprovoked like that,<<CRLF>>it sounds awfully sketchy!
#00101F...And you're one to talk, Black.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. For sure.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Allow me to introduce myself.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The name's Black. I'm an information dealer<<CRLF>>who's worked in this town for quite some time.<<CRLF>>
I've met you before, but it's not as if we spoke<<CRLF>>all that much then, either.<<CRLF>>
Either way, nice to meet you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol nodded shyly but politely.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, we're off to the Great Forest pretty<<CRLF>>soon, so...<<CRLF>>
#00100FYou got anything useful on it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... Maybe.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How does 100 gold sound?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How about 100 gold for some information on the<<CRLF>>Great Forest?<<CRLF>>
The Forest Labyrinth and the Misty Peak...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
As their names suggest, those who enter quickly<<CRLF>>lose their sense of direction and end up walking<<CRLF>>around in circles.
If you plan to cross it, you'd best keep a close<<CRLF>>eye on your surroundings.<<CRLF>>
Pay 100 gold
Politely decline
#4CAdol handed over 100 gold.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The information I have is about two of the most<<CRLF>>dangerous places in the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
They're commonly known as the 'Forest<<CRLF>>Labyrinth' and the 'Misty Peak.'<<CRLF>>
It's even easier to lose your way in those areas<<CRLF>>than in the rest of the forest, and before you<<CRLF>>know it, you're walking in circles.
They're not places you want to be, if you can<<CRLF>>help it.<<CRLF>>
#00105FI see.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo how do we get through them?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hah, damned if I know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I just know that those places exist. That's it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Other than that...uh, be careful, I guess?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FOh boy... Still, suppose you can't expect<<CRLF>>any more than that for a hundred gold.<<CRLF>>
#00100FEither way, seems like we'll just have to<<CRLF>>head into the forest and see for ourselves.<<CRLF>>
#4CYou don't have enough gold.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What, you don't even have 100 gold?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sorry, I've got nothing for you, then. This is<<CRLF>>a business, after all.<<CRLF>>
Come back when you've got some money!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All right, then, that's that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll be here if you ever change your mind.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The world is full of mysteries...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The only thing that can intoxicate me more than<<CRLF>>alcohol is the thrill of the unknown.<<CRLF>>
Aaah, mysteries are such wonderful things! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The only thing that can intoxicate me more than<<CRLF>>alcohol is the thrill of the unknown.<<CRLF>>
Aaah, mysteries are such wonderful things! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Alcohol is my partner in life. And that's no<<CRLF>>exaggeration!<<CRLF>>
But what I really want is a man who can<<CRLF>>intoxicate me even more than alcohol...<<CRLF>>
But where can I find somebody like that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
When the weather is pleasant, you can see a<<CRLF>>shadow that looks like a tower deep in the<<CRLF>>Great Forest.
I wonder if it's natural or man-made...<<CRLF>>Probably not natural! Maybe it's something else<<CRLF>>altogether. It's so mysterious!
Have you heard about the Romun Army's newest<<CRLF>>commander? Apparently he's the young, cool<<CRLF>>type.
With beautiful, long, orange hair and big eyes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He's not quite my type, but I'd still love to<<CRLF>>play with him once or twice. <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
*chug* *chug*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*chuckle* Drinking alcohol in the afternoon is<<CRLF>>so lovely, don't you think?<<CRLF>>
...Oh, are you alone today?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*chuckle* Do you want to join me for a drink?<<CRLF>>My treat.<<CRLF>>
*chuckle* Do you want to join me for a drink?<<CRLF>>My treat.<<CRLF>>
*chuckle* The wine in this place is truly in a<<CRLF>>class all its own. The owner has excellent<<CRLF>>taste.
...Well, mostly. I tend to shy away from any of<<CRLF>>the drinks that have 'muscle' in their name.<<CRLF>>
I'm Rouge. Not quite an information dealer,<<CRLF>>but I do have some...connections to that<<CRLF>>general line of work.
You wouldn't happen to be that Adol fellow who<<CRLF>>defeated the monster in the mine yesterday,<<CRLF>>would you?
That fiery red hair is just as spectacular<<CRLF>>as people say...<<CRLF>>
Duren, would you mind letting me borrow him<<CRLF>>for a while? Ten minutes is all I need.<<CRLF>>
#00101FNot a chance! What do you want with<<CRLF>>him, anyway?!<<CRLF>>
What do I want? Well...heh...never you mind.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you ever need anything...or even if you<<CRLF>>don't, feel free to come see me.<<CRLF>>
I'd be happy to tell all sorts of things to you<<CRLF>>two for free. <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
If you ever need anything...or even if you<<CRLF>>don't, feel free to come see me.<<CRLF>>
I'd be happy to tell all sorts of things to you<<CRLF>>two for free. <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
I'm amazed Brian can keep drinking my<<CRLF>>husband's specialties.<<CRLF>>
I'm grateful for his business, but I can't help<<CRLF>>feeling sorry for him on a personal level.<<CRLF>>
All right. I have a moment to catch my breath,<<CRLF>>so...time to take care of the books!<<CRLF>>
...Oh dear, why has so much been spent on<<CRLF>>ingredients this month?!<<CRLF>>
It seems like my husband's developing another<<CRLF>>new drink.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* What a waste of time.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It seems like my husband's developing another<<CRLF>>new drink.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* What a waste of time.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's such a lovely day today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I should be able to get all the sheets dry with<<CRLF>>no trouble at all.<<CRLF>>
It seems my husband beat another man at arm-<<CRLF>>wrestling when he tried to get close to Luluca.<<CRLF>>
I understand he wants to protect her from the<<CRLF>>more unsavory types, but...<<CRLF>>
...Well, actually, I think he kind of enjoys the<<CRLF>>challenge.<<CRLF>>
Honestly, though, he's turning this place into<<CRLF>>a circus!<<CRLF>>
I know he's doing it for Luluca, but still...<<CRLF>>arm-wrestling? Here?!<<CRLF>>
Honestly, he's turning this place into a circus!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Luluca is my daughter, but a lot of people don't<<CRLF>>believe me when I tell them that.<<CRLF>>
I can't understand why not, though. We look<<CRLF>>exactly alike! It's so rude...don't you think?<<CRLF>>
Welcome! It's still a bit early, but feel free<<CRLF>>to rest if you'd like.<<CRLF>>
I finished all the cleaning this morning, so do<<CRLF>>let me know if you need a room.<<CRLF>>
Casnan has really changed during the past few<<CRLF>>years.<<CRLF>>
There's nothing wrong with becoming a bit<<CRLF>>livelier, but there are more dangerous-looking<<CRLF>>folks here now as well.
And you're on the opposite end of the spectrum,<<CRLF>>Adol. You seem naive as can be! Be careful you<<CRLF>>don't let any of them take advantage of you.
You seem naive as can be, Adol. Be careful you<<CRLF>>don't let any of the ruffians around here take<<CRLF>>advantage of you!
It's important to be able to trust people, but<<CRLF>>a little healthy doubt is just as vital.<<CRLF>>
Well, if it isn't Adol! It looks like you're<<CRLF>>back to your old, perky self.<<CRLF>>
I was amazed when I heard about what you did<<CRLF>>yesterday.<<CRLF>>
No one would've imagined a traveler like you<<CRLF>>could defeat the monster before the army was<<CRLF>>even able to get to it!
You sure showed us! And now you're going to<<CRLF>>be mapping out the Great Forest, right?<<CRLF>>
I'm sure it goes without saying, but the Great<<CRLF>>Forest is a terrifying place.<<CRLF>>
You be careful in there, you hear?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're going to be mapping out the Great Forest,<<CRLF>>right?<<CRLF>>
I'm sure it goes without saying, but the Great<<CRLF>>Forest is a terrifying place.<<CRLF>>

Things like this have been known to happen on<<CRLF>>occasion during mining excavations.<<CRLF>>
I just hope no one gets injured...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Don't worry, I'll keep a spot reserved for you<<CRLF>>to rest.<<CRLF>>
Though it looks like I'm going to have to get<<CRLF>>ready to accept some injured people in here as<<CRLF>>well...
Sorry, but can you wait until I've finished<<CRLF>>setting things up?<<CRLF>>

Yesterday I finally managed to talk to a woman<<CRLF>>in the shop. We were both looking at the same<<CRLF>>item, and I made small talk with her.
And she...actually responded normally! I was<<CRLF>>really surprised.<<CRLF>>
See? I can do it when I try!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Now I just need to keep it up! Go me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
See? I can do it when I try!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Now I just need to keep it up! Go me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've made up my mind. I'm going to do it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I just have to try!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I can't just talk to a complete stranger in the<<CRLF>>middle of a shop...<<CRLF>>
But I can't just ignore this, either!<<CRLF>>What am I supposed to do?<<CRLF>>
I wish I had a better idea on how to make<<CRLF>>friends...<<CRLF>>
Maybe I should go out and work after all.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My husband and son are completely used to life<<CRLF>>here now. The only one who still hasn't adjusted<<CRLF>>is me.
*sigh* I wish I could get used to it already!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My husband Rid works at the mine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He gets on really well with the other miners<<CRLF>>there, so I don't need to worry about him too<<CRLF>>much.
Our son Lyle is good friends with Evan, the son<<CRLF>>of the head miner.<<CRLF>>
They had a bit of trouble getting on at first,<<CRLF>>but they're really good friends now.<<CRLF>>
Ah, to be a child again! They're both so honest<<CRLF>>and sincere with one another...<<CRLF>>
Lyle and Evan had a bit of trouble getting on at<<CRLF>>first, but they're really good friends now.<<CRLF>>
Ah, to be a child again! They're both so honest<<CRLF>>and sincere with one another...<<CRLF>>
I still can't do it, I still can't get used to<<CRLF>>life here.<<CRLF>>
It's been two years since I moved here with my<<CRLF>>family, and I just can't get used to it!<<CRLF>>
I'm hopeless, I know...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's been two years since I moved here with my<<CRLF>>family, and I just can't get used to it!<<CRLF>>
I'm hopeless, I know...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm going to talk to her... I will!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Unbelievable...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who'd have thought I'd find an angel in here?<<CRLF>>An angel, I tell you!<<CRLF>>
I didn't think he was this serious about her.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. But this is pretty good stuff! Can't wait<<CRLF>>to see what happens next.<<CRLF>>
I... I think he's seriously fallen for her.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. This should be interesting.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Aaah, drinking in a city like this is the<<CRLF>>best. <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
There's nothing better than a good buzz<<CRLF>>to chase all your tiredness away! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
New weapons, new weapons! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Good girls need good weapons, heheh! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if I've tried all the drinks this place<<CRLF>>has yet?<<CRLF>>
I don't really care that much about the taste<<CRLF>>of alcohol.<<CRLF>>
It's just for getting drunk, after all! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Alcohol's just for getting drunk, so who cares<<CRLF>>what it tastes like? <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
Hahaha! It's so much fun being drunk! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Aaah, drinking in the afternoon is the best! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hahaha, being an explorer is such an easy job! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Even if I can't get across to the Primeval<<CRLF>>Lands, there are still ways of making money<<CRLF>>on this side of the river.
I'll just do what I can, while I can.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Explorers really have to pay attention to the<<CRLF>>equipment they're using.<<CRLF>>
I've just made a fair amount selling all the<<CRLF>>treasure I found in the Great Forest, so it's<<CRLF>>shopping time!
Haha, Beaver's completely out of it now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But this... This is living!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's been rumored for a while, but they finally<<CRLF>>announced they're offering reward money for<<CRLF>>mapping out the Great Forest.
But know what's more important than money?<<CRLF>>Being alive to spend it! Problem is, if you've<<CRLF>>got nothing to spend, being alive is boring...
Aaaaanyway, just take it slow and see what<<CRLF>>happens, right? That's my motto!<<CRLF>>
*sigh* This is why I can't trust men.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How could I possibly keep exploring with a man<<CRLF>>who only ever looks at me with lusty eyes?!<<CRLF>>
Hmm... I get the feeling the secret to<<CRLF>>everything is in the Primeval Lands.<<CRLF>>
And if I can't get over there...well, then<<CRLF>>what point is there in being here?<<CRLF>>
Yeah, I think this suits you a lot better.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. It's perfect!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Are you serious?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're seriously saying you want to come<<CRLF>>exploring with me?!<<CRLF>>
Of course! Completely serious!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I can fight a bit now, and still cook and<<CRLF>>do laundry!<<CRLF>>
I... I want to become an explorer too!<<CRLF>>So won't you please be my partner?<<CRLF>>
Hmm... Well, we do work quite well together,<<CRLF>>so I suppose I could give it some thought...<<CRLF>>
But no matter what happens, we have to keep<<CRLF>>it strictly platonic, okay?<<CRLF>>
...What?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* I was only joking, but it looks like<<CRLF>>that's exactly what you were hoping for.<<CRLF>>
Err... No... I mean... What I meant to say was...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sniffle* She rejected me...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Life isn't fair...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
She said we can't be a team anymore...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Why? There are still plenty of places to<<CRLF>>explore, even if we're stuck on this side<<CRLF>>of the river...
...It's like we're dating or something!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No, no, what am I thinking?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I suppose it's about time I got back to<<CRLF>>exploring the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* Guess I should get myself ready.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* Finally, a chance to rest...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm never, EVER going to rely on those two<<CRLF>>explorers again! Ever!<<CRLF>>

#00900FNot surprised. We've barely rested since<<CRLF>>we left Promalock.<<CRLF>>
#00901FStill can't believe he came all this way to<<CRLF>>find wild Celcetan Flowers...<<CRLF>>
#00901FHe's one tough guy to go to all this trouble<<CRLF>>at his age, just to look for some medicinal<<CRLF>>herbs!
#00900F...And then we have you, set on exploring<<CRLF>>the Great Forest just because you're<<CRLF>>curious about it.
#00900FYou really aren't scared of anything, are<<CRLF>>you?<<CRLF>>
#00900FGuess I wouldn't have it any other way,<<CRLF>>though. If it weren't for you, that cursed<<CRLF>>island would still be cursed.

It's a deal!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Oh, 5000 Gold not enough for you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're quite the negotiator. I'm impressed.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Accept the offer of 5500 Gold

Still not satisfied? Hmph. I hadn't expected<<CRLF>>you to keep pushing this far.<<CRLF>>
...But I am a merchant, so I understand.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Out of respect for your passionate business<<CRLF>>sense, I'll stretch to 6250 Gold. And that's<<CRLF>>my final offer.
Accept the offer of 6250 Gold
Haggle even further
It's a deal, then!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hah. It's been quite a while since I've gotten<<CRLF>>so excited during a transaction.<<CRLF>>
Truly a pleasure doing business with you.<<CRLF>>I'd love to deal with you again.<<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Purchasing Iron Ore'!
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... It doesn't seem like you know when to<<CRLF>>stop haggling and accept what's on the table.<<CRLF>>
And without that skill, you've got quite<<CRLF>>a ways to go before you can call yourself<<CRLF>>a true merchant.
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'll have to<<CRLF>>purchase my iron elsewhere.<<CRLF>>
Let this be a lesson to you. Negotiation is<<CRLF>>a give-and-take enterprise. You can't just<<CRLF>>take and expect to come out on top.
#3CFailed the quest 'Purchasing Iron Ore'...
H-Hey! Hands off my kitchen!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, it's you, Adol. Thought it was a thief!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you so much for helping Wagner during<<CRLF>>the incident at the mine.<<CRLF>>
Are you Wagner's daughter?
Are you Wagner's wife?
Yes, I'm his daughter, Ada.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So, what brings you here today?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Do I really look that old? You wound me, sir!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm his daughter, Ada.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#4CAdol explained the treasure hunt game to Ada.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
A treasure hunt? For gold ore?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, you must be playing with my younger<<CRLF>>brother, Evan.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* That explains why he's been sneaking<<CRLF>>around all day.<<CRLF>>
I'm very sorry for the trouble.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ask about the Primeval Lands
Ask about the tower
The Primeval...what? Is that the name of a<<CRLF>>place in the Great Forest?<<CRLF>>
I'm sorry, I've never heard of it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There's a tower in the Great Forest?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... No, I'm sorry, I've never heard of<<CRLF>>anything like that before.<<CRLF>>
Very little is known about the Great Forest<<CRLF>>around here, after all.<<CRLF>>
Anyway, thank you for playing with Evan.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. You really are a nice person.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Feel free to come here again anytime.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And good luck treasure hunting!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CFound all of the hidden gold ore!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThis is the Goldsmith Trading Post.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThere are a bunch of handy shops here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FLike this smithy, where you can get your<<CRLF>>weapons and armor reinforced.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThis blacksmith can also refine ore into<<CRLF>>metals and gems if you bring him some<<CRLF>>to work with.
#00100FYou're going to need them, too, if you<<CRLF>>plan on doing any reinforcing.<<CRLF>>
#00100FFirst you look for some ore, then you<<CRLF>>refine it, then you use that refined ore to<<CRLF>>give weapons and armor a nice boost.
#00100FBest to keep all that in mind.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThat man over there is Goldsmith, the<<CRLF>>shop's owner.<<CRLF>>
#00100FIf you give him a bunch of one material,<<CRLF>>he'll exchange them for an item of higher<<CRLF>>quality.
#00100FAnd best of all, he doesn't charge<<CRLF>>anything, so it's definitely a service worth<<CRLF>>using.
#00103FIn other words, it's free. The best price<<CRLF>>of them all!<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat does it for the shops here in<<CRLF>>Casnan.<<CRLF>>

Seems like something has happened to Jive again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Doesn't seem to be that serious, at least.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's not often I see Jive preoccupied with<<CRLF>>something.<<CRLF>>
I wonder what happened to him.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There seem to be more and more explorers<<CRLF>>giving up on trying to map the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
Apparently, most of them because they can't<<CRLF>>work out how to get across the river.<<CRLF>>
Kind of a shame!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
For some unknown reason, the mist on the other<<CRLF>>side of the river cutting through the Great<<CRLF>>Forest seems to have cleared up.
Now you can see some kind of tower there<<CRLF>>when the weather's good.<<CRLF>>
Really stimulates the imagination!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Keep this on the down low, but I hear this new<<CRLF>>Governor General is actually pretty good at her<<CRLF>>job.
All of the Governor Generals here to date have<<CRLF>>been obsessed with money and raising taxes, so<<CRLF>>I'm pleased to hear we've got a good one.
...Though if she's not all about money, that<<CRLF>>just makes it more difficult to figure out what<<CRLF>>she's really after.

I'm not originally from this area, so I was kind<<CRLF>>of surprised to see just how much mystique the<<CRLF>>Great Forest holds.
I came here to do business, of course, so that's<<CRLF>>a bit outside my area of expertise. But I can't<<CRLF>>deny the appeal of the unknown, either way...
Have you gotten used to the Great Forest yet?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There's nothing wrong with focusing on your ex-<<CRLF>>pedition, but don't forget to drop by from time<<CRLF>>to time. A well-stocked hero is a happy hero!
Whenever you've gathered some materials, I'd be<<CRLF>>happy to see what I can do with them.<<CRLF>>

I handle materials from all over the region<<CRLF>>here at this trading post.<<CRLF>>
So if you find anything unusual in the Great<<CRLF>>Forest, just bring it to me!<<CRLF>>
Long as you've gathered enough, I'd be happy<<CRLF>>to exchange them for an item of higher quality.<<CRLF>>

I didn't get any breakfast today, and I don't<<CRLF>>know why.<<CRLF>>
All my mother would say is, 'if I'm not here,<<CRLF>>you won't be able to eat.'<<CRLF>>
Why, Mother? I don't understand!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What are you trying to tell me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Why, Mother? I don't understand!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My mother's been acting strangely lately.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't know what she's thinking, but it's<<CRLF>>probably nothing good.<<CRLF>>
My mother can be really difficult to deal with<<CRLF>>sometimes.<<CRLF>>
Yesterday she was wailing loudly because<<CRLF>>she didn't like that something or other wasn't<<CRLF>>going the way she wanted it to.
That's life, Mother!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My mother can be really difficult to deal with<<CRLF>>sometimes.<<CRLF>>
Life's not always fair, Mother! You need to<<CRLF>>learn to deal with it!<<CRLF>>
Apparently the Romun soldiers haven't come back<<CRLF>>since entering the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
Maybe they're living in tents. That sounds...<<CRLF>>really awful.<<CRLF>>
Someone once said that gems hold a demonic<<CRLF>>power.<<CRLF>>
When you think about it, there do seem to be<<CRLF>>a lot of wars revolving around them. It's kind<<CRLF>>of sad.
Why do women like gems so much?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Is it an instinct thing, like how men are drawn<<CRLF>>to swords?<<CRLF>>
Gusev seems careless at first glance, but he<<CRLF>>actually does really delicate work.<<CRLF>>
He's a model artisan.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Has something among Goldsmith's wares<<CRLF>>caught your eye?<<CRLF>>
See these here? An ancient treasure, and a<<CRLF>>replica of it. They're two of his finest items.<<CRLF>>

Seems like Jive's mother is planning something,<<CRLF>>though I don't know what.<<CRLF>>
Mother and son sure do get along well, though!<<CRLF>>Hahaha...<<CRLF>>
Jive's been acting strange all day.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I suppose he's about that age now...<<CRLF>>Oh, the worries of youth!<<CRLF>>
It sounds like a lot of explorers are giving up<<CRLF>>on mapping the forest.<<CRLF>>
It's a tough place to explore, and dangerous<<CRLF>>to boot...but it's still kinda sad people are<<CRLF>>giving up on it, you know?
Might not be my place to say, but don't you<<CRLF>>guys give up too, okay? Keep the dream alive!<<CRLF>>
Suppose the fact you can see that tower now<<CRLF>>means something happened on the other side of<<CRLF>>the river, huh?
Wish someone could get across and bring us<<CRLF>>back some information. Doesn't matter who.<<CRLF>>
Seems like the army's having it rough lately,<<CRLF>>too. Not like it's any of my business.<<CRLF>>
Glad I'm an artisan. I can take it easy and just<<CRLF>>work all day. No worries about soldiers or<<CRLF>>forests or anything. And I sure do love my job!
Time to get back to work.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Those who don't work shouldn't eat. That's the<<CRLF>>way of the world.<<CRLF>>
What, you wanna talk to me? Well if you want<<CRLF>>a lecture on winning over girls, I'm your man.<<CRLF>>
...Pff. Yeah, right. Do I look like I'm popular<<CRLF>>with the ladies?<<CRLF>>
Yeeeeah, enough talking. If you're not here for<<CRLF>>business, then just move along. I'm a busy man,<<CRLF>>you know!
If you're not here for business, I don't have<<CRLF>>time for you. Sorry.<<CRLF>>
You'll just get in the way of my work.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Did you bring some minerals? I can use them to<<CRLF>>reinforce your armor.<<CRLF>>
It's gonna cost you, though.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Minmi had a bigger reaction to the idea of being<<CRLF>>an older sister than I expected.<<CRLF>>
Heheh. It seems like my husband and I have<<CRLF>>some work to do! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if I was a bit harsh on Minmi<<CRLF>>yesterday...<<CRLF>>
...No, I'm doing what I have to.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's for her own good. If I'm not going to be<<CRLF>>strict with her, then who is?<<CRLF>>
I'm not wrong. I'm doing what I have to do.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's for her own good. If I'm not going to be<<CRLF>>strict with her, then who is?<<CRLF>>
Our Minmi's a greedy little girl.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Whenever I ask her which she wants of anything,<<CRLF>>she'll always say, 'All of them!'<<CRLF>>
But she's going to be an older sister one<<CRLF>>day, so she needs to start learning some<<CRLF>>self-control.

Ahaha! It's so much fun being able to watch<<CRLF>>your children grow up!<<CRLF>>
Hee, the best way to get Minmi to go to sleep<<CRLF>>is to read something to her.<<CRLF>>
Minmi keeps going on and on about 'the truth!'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll have to read her a story to get her to go<<CRLF>>to sleep tonight, I guess.<<CRLF>>
Minmi really loves her daddy.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
She doesn't even know what it means, but<<CRLF>>she's already started saying, 'I'm going to marry<<CRLF>>Daddy!' It's adorable.
It might be a bit early, but I suppose<<CRLF>>I should be thinking about what to do for dinner<<CRLF>>tonight.
My husband needs the energy to work, after all.<<CRLF>>A good housewife must always be mindful of her<<CRLF>>family's needs!
Whew... I need to take a break. My hips are<<CRLF>>killing me!<<CRLF>>
*rub* Wait... Isn't this what old people do?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No, no, that's not true, Ada! That's not true at<<CRLF>>all!<<CRLF>>
Everyone rubs their hips when they hurt. Age has<<CRLF>>nothing to do with it! Nothing at all!<<CRLF>>
Housework is forever! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>Housework is a noble duty! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
Ah, a speck of dust! DIE, MONSTER!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* There really is no end to the amount of<<CRLF>>housework around here...but, that's all the<<CRLF>>more reason I have to get it done, I suppose!
All right, let's get this place looking spick<<CRLF>>and span!<<CRLF>>
Go, go, me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh no, the dust is building up already!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Dust is such a strange thing...<<CRLF>>Where does it all come from?<<CRLF>>
First you help my father out, then you help my<<CRLF>>younger brother... You really are a nice person.<<CRLF>>
Feel free to come here again anytime.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
As the head miner, everyone in town trusts my<<CRLF>>father.<<CRLF>>
And I'm a fine daughter for always supporting<<CRLF>>him from the shadows. <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
Honestly, that Evan... I'm happy he has fun with<<CRLF>>his friend, but I wish he wouldn't always come<<CRLF>>home with dirty clothes!
If only he'd spare a thought for his poor sister<<CRLF>>who has to do all the washing...<<CRLF>>
All right, time to get started on today's<<CRLF>>housework!<<CRLF>>
I need to make my son appreciate the charms<<CRLF>>of women, so first I've decided to make him<<CRLF>>appreciate the importance of a housewife.
I need to teach him to stop being so spoiled<<CRLF>>and start appreciating the things he takes for<<CRLF>>granted.
Yes, that seems like a perfect first lesson!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I need to teach my son to stop being so spoiled<<CRLF>>and start appreciating the things he takes for<<CRLF>>granted.
Yes, that seems like a perfect first lesson!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How am I supposed to make my son understand<<CRLF>>the appeal of Ada?<<CRLF>>
...Why am I even thinking about this?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* I feel kind of pathetic.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Before I start trying to make him appreciate<<CRLF>>Ada, I need to do something about my son's<<CRLF>>mindset.
But how should I go about it? Hmmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
They say children don't appreciate their<<CRLF>>parents, and it's very true.<<CRLF>>
I realize it's selfish of me to want my son to<<CRLF>>get together with Ada...<<CRLF>>
But 'I've got no interest in girls' is going<<CRLF>>a bit too far, surely! *sigh* The future is<<CRLF>>looking grim.

But 'I've got no interest in girls' is going<<CRLF>>a bit too far, surely! *sigh* The future is<<CRLF>>looking grim.
Jive's not a bad boy, but he doesn't talk very<<CRLF>>much.<<CRLF>>
That's what makes him such a perfect contrast<<CRLF>>to Ada, though!<<CRLF>>
I've got a son named Jive who works at the<<CRLF>>trading post.<<CRLF>>
My secret ambition is to get him to marry Ada.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ada's such a lovely girl. So lovely, I wish<<CRLF>>she were my daughter!<<CRLF>>
...Oops. The head miner would not be happy if<<CRLF>>he heard me say that.<<CRLF>>
I wonder if Ada's working hard today too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. I just can't help myself!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The mine chief's daughter, Ada, is such a fine<<CRLF>>young lady.<<CRLF>>
Ever since her mother died a few years ago,<<CRLF>>she's been trying her hardest to take care of<<CRLF>>the family in her place.
I'm sure it's difficult for her, but she never<<CRLF>>lets it show.<<CRLF>>
She's always cheerful and positive.<<CRLF>>It's almost infectious!<<CRLF>>
The mine chief's daughter Ada is such a fine<<CRLF>>young lady.<<CRLF>>
She's cheerful, she's a hard worker, she's<<CRLF>>optimistic... I really like her.<<CRLF>>
Never really thought about it before, but Leo's<<CRLF>>actually quite different from all the smug,<<CRLF>>arrogant Romun soldiers I'm used to seeing.
He's not very polite, but he doesn't care<<CRLF>>about lining his pockets like the others.<<CRLF>>I rather miss seeing him around here lately.
I've been watching Governor General Griselda<<CRLF>>ever since she arrived in Casnan.<<CRLF>>
It seems like even among the Romuns, there are<<CRLF>>all kinds of different people.<<CRLF>>
...I suppose all this time, I've just been<<CRLF>>unfairly lumping them all together.<<CRLF>>

Governor General Griselda really is different<<CRLF>>from all the other Governor Generals we've had<<CRLF>>here before.
The other day I saw a notice issued by the<<CRLF>>Governor General's office saying that they're<<CRLF>>going to repair the old worn-out water system.
...Before, we would've had to complain<<CRLF>>constantly before the government would<<CRLF>>even take a vote on something like that!
If all the Romuns were like her, I doubt I would<<CRLF>>ever have come to hate them.<<CRLF>>

It seems all the soldiers who came from Romn<<CRLF>>have been sent out into the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
I can't believe they're all being sent to a<<CRLF>>dangerous place like that!<<CRLF>>
I can't say I like Romn, but I do feel pity for<<CRLF>>the soldiers themselves.<<CRLF>>

Seems like there was a bit of a commotion by<<CRLF>>the gate yesterday.<<CRLF>>
He might not have succeeded in getting that girl<<CRLF>>down off the roof of that building, but that was<<CRLF>>still a rare display of manliness from Leo.
I wonder what made him go so far...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder when the war between Romn and<<CRLF>>Altago will come to an end. It just keeps drag-<<CRLF>>ging on...
I thought the Romun invasion of Afroca would<<CRLF>>go a lot more smoothly.<<CRLF>>
The Altaginian Dragon Knights must be extremely<<CRLF>>tough.<<CRLF>>
I mean, naturally, they know the land better<<CRLF>>than the Romuns, but surely they can't beat<<CRLF>>them when it comes to military strength...
Still, I'm happy someone's showing the Romuns<<CRLF>>they can't always have their own way.<<CRLF>>
The Altaginians need to keep it up.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Everyone has their issues with the Romuns, but<<CRLF>>thanks to them, this country's prospering right<<CRLF>>now.
Say what you like, but they're not all bad.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Doesn't give them the right to strut about<<CRLF>>like they own the place, though.<<CRLF>>
Say what you like, but not all the Romuns are<<CRLF>>bad.<<CRLF>>
...Doesn't give them the right to strut about<<CRLF>>like they own the place, though.<<CRLF>>
I don't like the Romuns.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You only have to look at Leo to see a perfect<<CRLF>>example of why. They're only concerned with<<CRLF>>their own image. All talk and no action.
That young man who defeated the monster in<<CRLF>>the mine recently, and didn't ask for anything in<<CRLF>>return...Adol, was it?
The Romuns could stand to learn a few things<<CRLF>>from him.<<CRLF>>

Naturally, you'll be responsible for protecting<<CRLF>>yourself, but I'll be able to support you to a<<CRLF>>certain extent.
So, how about it? Would you be prepared to<<CRLF>>journey into the Great Forest with me?<<CRLF>>
Thirty percent of all earnings, huh?<<CRLF>>Are you seriously going to give me that much?<<CRLF>>
Of course. It's a significant risk on your part<<CRLF>>as well.<<CRLF>>
True. We are challenging the dreaded Great<<CRLF>>Forest of Celceta, after all.<<CRLF>>
Well, considering it's uncharted territory, I'm<<CRLF>>not expecting much in the way of guidance from<<CRLF>>you.
I'm more counting on your general knowledge of<<CRLF>>the local area and its edibles. That sort of thing.<<CRLF>>
So how about it? Are you in?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If it works out, I'll be able to earn a good sum<<CRLF>>of money from it, that's for sure.<<CRLF>>
But am I really going to be able to come out of<<CRLF>>this alive?<<CRLF>>
My exploration of the Great Forest is over now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm disappointed I didn't get to see the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands for myself, but I can't find<<CRLF>>any way of getting across that river.
At least I can try to make some money out<<CRLF>>of the information I did manage to gather,<<CRLF>>though...

#0MStill, this is quite the coincidence.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI recently heard of a mysterious island called<<CRLF>>Esteria in the east, long cloaked in violent,<<CRLF>>impenetrable winds.
#0MAnd I also heard that it was freed from its<<CRLF>>'Stormwall' by a young red-haired man much<<CRLF>>like yourself.
#00100FNow that you mention it, I heard<<CRLF>>something similar from a traveler in<<CRLF>>the bar myself, a while back.
#00103F...Buuut, there's no way...right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MRegardless, I would like to extend my deepest<<CRLF>>thanks to you for all you've done here, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#0MAnd...there is one other issue I would also like<<CRLF>>to discuss with you.<<CRLF>>
#10101FAre you familiar with the Great Forest of<<CRLF>>Celceta to the northwest of here?<<CRLF>>
Of course.
Maybe. Maybe not.
#10103F...Well, then, that certainly simplifies<<CRLF>>matters.<<CRLF>>
#10105FIt is said that few who enter the Great<<CRLF>>Forest ever return alive.<<CRLF>>
#10104F...Well? Which one is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105F(Adol, just say you've never heard of it<<CRLF>>or this is going to get real confusing, real<<CRLF>>fast!)
#10105FIt's said that those who set foot into<<CRLF>>the Great Forest immediately lose their<<CRLF>>bearings.
#10105FFerocious beasts prowl its expanses,<<CRLF>>and few have ever returned alive.<<CRLF>>
#10105FAs such, even our army has been<<CRLF>>hesitant to explore its depths, leaving<<CRLF>>it mostly an uncharted wilderness.
#10100FHowever, we've recently received orders<<CRLF>>from Romn instructing us to find new<<CRLF>>gold deposits. We must make haste.
#10100FI therefore have a formal request for you,<<CRLF>>Adol Christin.<<CRLF>>
#10100FWould you consider undertaking the task<<CRLF>>of mapping the Great Forest on our behalf?<<CRLF>>
Mapping it?
I'll need some time to think.
#10105FAgain, it is an uncharted wilderness.<<CRLF>>Few set foot within, and fewer return.<<CRLF>>Therefore, no map presently exists.
#10105FYou would begin a thorough expedition<<CRLF>>into the forest starting tomorrow,<<CRLF>>carefully mapping every melye.
#10104FI see... To be honest, I had expected<<CRLF>>you to accept my offer right away.<<CRLF>>
#10100FI cannot deny that it will be a dangerous<<CRLF>>task indeed, but you will be rewarded<<CRLF>>most generously for your efforts.
#10100FTomorrow we will be formally announcing<<CRLF>>the quest, and presenting the first able<<CRLF>>to complete it with a large sum of gold.
#00100FWhat kind of money are we talking<<CRLF>>about here?<<CRLF>>
#10105FIt will be awarded in installments, based<<CRLF>>on percentage explored. In total, our<<CRLF>>budget is thirty million gold.
#00109F*whistle* Not bad at all...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FNumerous explorers and prospectors have<<CRLF>>already heard rumors of this and begun<<CRLF>>gathering here in Casnan.
#10103FIf you are interested, I would like to<<CRLF>>hear your answer as soon as possible.<<CRLF>>Before sundown tomorrow, preferably.
#10103FHowever, the hour is late, so please,<<CRLF>>rest for the night. There's a room at the<<CRLF>>inn... I am hopeful you will think it over.
#0M...It seems you've been able to fully complete<<CRLF>>the map as far as the river.<<CRLF>>
#0MI had expected great things from you, and you<<CRLF>>still managed to exceed those expectations.<<CRLF>>
#0MI was right to leave this in your hands.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0M...It seems you've been able to complete<<CRLF>>most of the map as far as the river.<<CRLF>>
#0MI had expected great things from you, and<<CRLF>>you are most certainly delivering.<<CRLF>>
#0MI was right to leave this in your hands.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0M...It seems you've been able to map part<<CRLF>>of the forest as far as the river, but...there<<CRLF>>are still a great many gaps.
#0MTo be honest, I'd expected a little more<<CRLF>>from you...<<CRLF>>
#0MStill, the Great Forest is a formidable<<CRLF>>adversary. It's only natural you wouldn't<<CRLF>>be able to explore it all so easily.
#10100F...Please accept this as a reward for<<CRLF>>your efforts thus far.<<CRLF>>
#10100FI also wish to present you with this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100F...Please accept this as a reward for<<CRLF>>your efforts thus far.<<CRLF>>
#10100FI also wish to present you with this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FI hear that explorers and bounty hunters<<CRLF>>have entered the forest as well, though it<<CRLF>>is proving a challenge for them.
#10103FI will be eagerly awaiting your next visit,<<CRLF>>gentlemen.<<CRLF>>
#10103FIs there anything else you wish to report,<<CRLF>>Adol?<<CRLF>>
Tell her about the river
Tell her about Bami and Gadis
#00111FWell, we still have no idea how to get<<CRLF>>across the river...<<CRLF>>
#00111FWe don't know what's on the other side,<<CRLF>>either. All we know is that the folks living<<CRLF>>close by call it the 'Primeval Lands.'
#10105FThat is a significant obstacle.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FYou mentioned a number of ruins you've<<CRLF>>found within the Great Forest, no?<<CRLF>>
#10100FPerhaps you'll be able to find some<<CRLF>>ancient records that might point you in<<CRLF>>the right direction.
#00100FYeah, I guess we'll just have to keep<<CRLF>>looking.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOh, and one more thing... You wouldn't<<CRLF>>happen to know anything about those<<CRLF>>two people we fought, would you?
#10105FThe magician and the beast tamer?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FAt the very least, I have not given<<CRLF>>permission for any such individuals to<<CRLF>>explore the Great Forest.
#00111FNo help there either, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FThe magician and the beast tamer you<<CRLF>>encountered?<<CRLF>>
#10100FAt the very least, I have not given<<CRLF>>permission for any such individuals to<<CRLF>>explore the Great Forest.
#00111FThey both seemed pretty tough. Kinda<<CRLF>>worries me, you know?<<CRLF>>
#10105FTwo such individuals appearing in the<<CRLF>>Great Forest is a great matter of concern.<<CRLF>>I fear it may not be a coincidence.
#10105FUntil recently, I may have suspected<<CRLF>>them to be spies from Ispani, as our<<CRLF>>forces had been in conflict with them.
#10100FHowever, we can discount that now.<<CRLF>>Ispani no longer has the willpower nor<<CRLF>>ability to pose such a threat.
#00111F*sigh* Nothing new, then...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FWe've still got no leads on how to<<CRLF>>cross the river, either.<<CRLF>>
#00111FAnd we don't have any idea what's<<CRLF>>over there, aside from knowing that<<CRLF>>it's called the 'Primeval Lands.'
#10100FYou mentioned a number of ruins you've<<CRLF>>found within the Great Forest, no?<<CRLF>>
#10100FPerhaps you'll be able to find some ancient<<CRLF>>records that might point you in the right<<CRLF>>direction.
#00100FYeah, I guess we'll just have to keep<<CRLF>>looking.<<CRLF>>
#00101F...I gotta say, though, it really feels like<<CRLF>>our investigation's hit a wall.<<CRLF>>
#10100FRather than blindly searching for where to<<CRLF>>go next, perhaps it would be wise to take<<CRLF>>this opportunity to stop and reflect.
#10103FMight I suggest you rest here in Casnan<<CRLF>>for a while?<<CRLF>>
#10103FI will be sending the Romun Army into<<CRLF>>the Great Forest soon.<<CRLF>>
#10103FShould I hear any reports from them that<<CRLF>>may be of interest to you, I will be certain<<CRLF>>to inform you as soon as possible.
#00109FThe Romun Army? ...Now that you men-<<CRLF>>tion it, there did seem to be more soldiers<<CRLF>>around Casnan than usual.
#10105FUntil recently, our forces have been in a<<CRLF>>stalemate with the Altaginian army on the<<CRLF>>southern Afrocan front.
#10105FHowever, in recent years, their Dragon<<CRLF>>Knights have been rapidly gaining strength.<<CRLF>>
#10100FI hear they've created a new kind of<<CRLF>>warship capable of incredible speed.<<CRLF>>
#10100FSo in an effort to keep the Altaginians at<<CRLF>>bay, Romn has elected to deploy additional<<CRLF>>forces to the continent's western regions.
#00111FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FFeels strange to think of all the things<<CRLF>>changing in the world while we're out<<CRLF>>fighting monsters in the woods.
#10103FTo speak frankly, these forces were sent<<CRLF>>here without my input, and feel unneeded.<<CRLF>>You two are far more valuable.
#10103FAt any rate, I'm afraid I have a meeting to<<CRLF>>attend to. But if you require anything, do<<CRLF>>feel free to let me know.
#00103FGotcha. Thanks a bunch!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10108FOh my... I had high hopes for your efforts,<<CRLF>>but this is truly exceptional work.<<CRLF>>
#10106FI could hardly have hoped for more.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10103FI am simply awestruck, gentlemen.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHaha... I appreciate the compliment, but<<CRLF>>stop, please! I'm blushing over here!<<CRLF>>
Ask her to stop
Ask to be praised more
#10103FHaha. Very well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10103FThere is no need to be modest. You<<CRLF>>have done excellent work and deserve<<CRLF>>to be suitably rewarded for it.
#10106FAnd as such, I would like to present you<<CRLF>>with this.<<CRLF>>
#10106FHah. You're quite a courageous young<<CRLF>>man to solicit praise from an army<<CRLF>>general.
#10106FI don't feel that expressing the same<<CRLF>>sentiment again and again in different<<CRLF>>ways serves much purpose, however.
#10103FBut you have done excellent work, truly.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10103FAnd as such, I would like to present you<<CRLF>>with this.<<CRLF>>
#10103FAs well as this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FAnd here is your payment.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10108FMy, it appears you have made excellent<<CRLF>>progress.<<CRLF>>
#10105FI wasn't expecting you to be able to<<CRLF>>demonstrate such top-quality results<<CRLF>>in such a short period of time.
#10103FI eagerly anticipate hearing of your<<CRLF>>continued exploits.<<CRLF>>
#00103FWell, it's pretty motivating to hear that.<<CRLF>>Thank you.<<CRLF>>
Agree with Duren
Ask for a more tangible reward
#10106FI'm glad the opinion of this officer means<<CRLF>>so much to you.<<CRLF>>
#10103FI also have another reward for you in<<CRLF>>addition to your payment.<<CRLF>>
#10103FPlease, accept it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10106FSo impertinent! There's no need to worry,<<CRLF>>though. I have prepared something special<<CRLF>>for you.
#10103FPlease, accept it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FAnd here is your payment.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FYou've made exceptional progress to<<CRLF>>have filled this much space in such a<<CRLF>>short amount of time.
#10100FHere is the reward for your efforts thus<<CRLF>>far.<<CRLF>>
#10103FI bid you farewell for now, but I look<<CRLF>>forward to hearing of your continued<<CRLF>>exploits.
#10103FI bid you farewell for now, but I will be<<CRLF>>eagerly awaiting your next report.<<CRLF>>
#10100FThe map is essentially complete.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FThanks to your efforts, we now know<<CRLF>>everything that lies in the Primeval<<CRLF>>Lands as well.
#10103FI cannot think I can thank you enough,<<CRLF>>and yet I feel I must at least try. I am truly,<<CRLF>>truly grateful for all your hard work.
#00100F...If you don't mind me asking, what're<<CRLF>>you planning on doing with this map?<<CRLF>>
#10100FOfficially, it will be used for the purpose<<CRLF>>of developing the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
#10100FThough I assure you, that sounds<<CRLF>>much worse than it is.<<CRLF>>
#10105F...Regrettably, however, that's all I can<<CRLF>>tell you. Please forgive my brevity.<<CRLF>>
#10101FAt the very least, I can promise you that<<CRLF>>it will not be used in a way which is<<CRLF>>detrimental to this country or its people.
I'll be rooting for you.
How can we trust you?
#10106FI hadn't expected to hear such words<<CRLF>>from you, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#10103FI genuinely appreciate the sentiment.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10104FThat is a fair question, though it does<<CRLF>>sting a bit. I thought I'd earned your<<CRLF>>trust by now.
#10105FI will continue to follow my own convic-<<CRLF>>tions and do what I must. And I'd ask<<CRLF>>that you have faith in me to that end.
#10101FI assume you'll be returning to the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands, but please, do take<<CRLF>>care.
#10101FI hope to see you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo you're Wallace?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe saw your quest on the board.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That's me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So you've come to accept it, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FWell, that depends on the details.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Fair enough.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All I ask is for you to run a little errand on<<CRLF>>my behalf.<<CRLF>>
I'll give you the funds, so go to the item shop<<CRLF>>and buy me some Honey Potions. That's all there<<CRLF>>is to it.
#00111F...Wait, seriously? You can't just go there<<CRLF>>yourself?<<CRLF>>
#00101FAre you really that lazy?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, I have my reasons, let's just put it that<<CRLF>>way.<<CRLF>>
So, will you accept?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, did you change your mind?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Accept
Decline
Oh well. Guess I'll have to wait for someone<<CRLF>>else to come along, then.<<CRLF>>
Goodbye.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Really? Thanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo...we just have to buy you three<<CRLF>>Honey Potions, and that's it?<<CRLF>>
#00100FGuess we'll get going, then. You said<<CRLF>>you'd provide the funds, right?<<CRLF>>
Right. Here you are.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...You're kidding me. Don't, uh, people<<CRLF>>usually deal in MONEY around here?<<CRLF>>
Hold on, now, don't give me that look!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It might not be gold, but it's still payment.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* I get it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou want us to exchange this, then.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Exactly!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you sell those as they are, you won't get<<CRLF>>much for them.<<CRLF>>
But if you exchange them for something a bit<<CRLF>>more valuable at the trading post, you'll<<CRLF>>get a lot more.
Trade them all for Sturdy Bones, and you should<<CRLF>>be able to sell those for three hundred gold.<<CRLF>>
And buying three Honey Potions costs exactly<<CRLF>>that. See?<<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* We might not be losing any<<CRLF>>money, but I still feel kinda cheated<<CRLF>>somehow.
#00100FCome on, Adol. Let's go get this over<<CRLF>>with.<<CRLF>>
Haha. Thanks.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHere you go, from the market.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Perfect, thanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This is the stuff indeed. Exactly what I was<<CRLF>>looking for! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
It's a wonder I managed to buy the wrong thing<<CRLF>>before.<<CRLF>>
#00109FYou bought the wrong thing?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yeah. The other day, I went to the item shop to<<CRLF>>buy some Honey Potions...<<CRLF>>
And somehow wound up walking out with Bitter<<CRLF>>Potions instead.<<CRLF>>
And those Bitter Potions are your reward, so<<CRLF>>here you go.<<CRLF>>
I don't know who buys these things. Bitter AND<<CRLF>>more expensive? Unbelievable! But they're<<CRLF>>apparently high-quality, so...what do I know?
Bottoms up, gentlemen! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*gulp* *gulp*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16SAaah, that's the stuff!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Nothing goes with food better than a good<<CRLF>>Honey Potion! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
#00111FI-I see... Well, glad we could be of<<CRLF>>service, I guess!<<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Honey Potions'!
Governor General Griselda is always a shining<<CRLF>>beacon of hope for me.<<CRLF>>
So if you were ever to do anything to dull that<<CRLF>>shine...I'd never forgive you.<<CRLF>>
Governor General Griselda seems even more<<CRLF>>tired today than usual.<<CRLF>>
You'd better watch your manners when talking<<CRLF>>to her!<<CRLF>>
What? Go ahead in if you want.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But don't cause the Governor General any<<CRLF>>trouble. I don't care if you mean to or not.<<CRLF>>
Lately Governor General Griselda has been<<CRLF>>traveling huge distances between here and the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands.
She hasn't been back in Casnan for very long at<<CRLF>>all.<<CRLF>>
She doesn't show it, but I'm betting she must be<<CRLF>>exhausted.<<CRLF>>
So if you have something to say to her, make it<<CRLF>>quick!<<CRLF>>
The Governor General doesn't show it, but I'm<<CRLF>>betting she must be exhausted.<<CRLF>>
So if you have something to say to her, make it<<CRLF>>quick!<<CRLF>>
The Governor General isn't in her room at the<<CRLF>>moment.<<CRLF>>
If you want to report on the map, come back<<CRLF>>another day.<<CRLF>>
Hey. I see your partner's not with you today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Eh, whatever. If you have business with the<<CRLF>>Governor General, hurry up and get it over with.<<CRLF>>
She's been exhausted lately. Maybe it's a result<<CRLF>>of having to deal with the Romun Army.<<CRLF>>
You must be pretty tough to be able to return<<CRLF>>from the Great Forest unharmed.<<CRLF>>
Keep it up.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Governor General Griselda is tired from all<<CRLF>>the work she has to do.<<CRLF>>
If you have business with her, make it quick.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've been told to allow you to enter whenever<<CRLF>>you'd like.<<CRLF>>
But don't get cocky. You may be allowed in,<<CRLF>>but don't think that means you can just come<<CRLF>>and go whenever you please.
You're a lucky guy to be able to talk to the<<CRLF>>Governor General personally.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* It sure would be nice to get called<<CRLF>>inside instead of just standing guard here<<CRLF>>all day.

#10100FAh, you've come to report your progress<<CRLF>>on the map? Let's hear it, then!<<CRLF>>
#10105F...It appears you have not made signi-<<CRLF>>ficant progress since you last gave a<<CRLF>>report.
#10100FCould I ask you to come again when you<<CRLF>>have made more progress?<<CRLF>>
#10100FIf you're interested, I would like to hear<<CRLF>>your answer as soon as possible.<<CRLF>>Before sundown tomorrow, preferably.
#10105FHowever, the hour is late, so please,<<CRLF>>rest for the night. There's a room at the<<CRLF>>inn... I am hopeful you will think it over.
#10105FI have arranged for you to stay at the<<CRLF>>inn. Please rest there for tonight.<<CRLF>>
#10100FI assume you know of the inn's location?<<CRLF>>You should get some rest there. It's late.<<CRLF>>
#10100FAh, greetings, Adol Christin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FTo reiterate what I said earlier, please<<CRLF>>give your reports on the map directly to<<CRLF>>me.
#10105FYou will receive a portion of the reward<<CRLF>>every time you make significant progress<<CRLF>>on mapping out the forest.
#10105FAnd at certain milestones, I'll present<<CRLF>>you with a bonus in addition to your<<CRLF>>usual payment.
#10100FI hope this will serve as motivation to<<CRLF>>you, although I don't wish to stress the<<CRLF>>potential rewards too much.
#10100FCommander Leo is keeping me informed<<CRLF>>of Gruda's actions via carrier pigeon.<<CRLF>>
#10105F...Gruda's actions are now entirely<<CRLF>>removed from the intentions of Romn.<<CRLF>>He must be stopped.
#10100FCommander Leo, myself and the other<<CRLF>>Romuns in Celceta are doing all we can.<<CRLF>>But we're also counting on you.
#10100FPlease do your best, Adol Christin. Your<<CRLF>>success is of paramount importance to<<CRLF>>us all.
#10100FPlease do your best, Adol Christin. Your<<CRLF>>success is of paramount importance to<<CRLF>>us all.
#10100FI will support you as best as I can so<<CRLF>>that you may dedicate yourself fully to<<CRLF>>your task.
#10105FWe cannot allow outsiders to find out<<CRLF>>about the existence of Highland, and<<CRLF>>Romn itself is no exception.
#10100FThe soldiers here have been ordered<<CRLF>>to keep all information confidential,<<CRLF>>and have been chosen for their loyalty.
#10100FI trust you and your companions, but do<<CRLF>>take care what you say to the people of<<CRLF>>Casnan.

#10100FI trust you and your companions, but do<<CRLF>>take care what you say to the people of<<CRLF>>Casnan.
#10100FEven Romn has not fully grasped all the<<CRLF>>details behind Gruda's Masked Division.<<CRLF>>
#10100FI cannot predict what they'll do next, but<<CRLF>>I will be following their movements as best<<CRLF>>as I can through Commander Leo.
#10100FI fear they may cause you further diffi-<<CRLF>>culties, but I believe you will be able to<<CRLF>>persevere, no matter what happens.

#10100FAh, it's a pleasure to see you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FTo reiterate what I said earlier, I have no<<CRLF>>intention of restricting your activities in the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands.
#10105FHowever, I would ask that you take care<<CRLF>>not to let any knowledge you gain there<<CRLF>>leak to others.
#10100FYour mission to complete the map still<<CRLF>>stands, and I'm anticipating many reports<<CRLF>>of your continued efforts.
#10100FShould you require anything else, please<<CRLF>>let me know.<<CRLF>>

#10100FShould you require anything else, please<<CRLF>>let me know.<<CRLF>>
#10100FAh, Adol Christin. I see you've come<<CRLF>>alone today.<<CRLF>>
#10100FIf you're unable to cross the river,<<CRLF>>now would be a good time to rest, then<<CRLF>>think again once your mind is clear.
#10100FI apologize for any disturbance from the<<CRLF>>Romun Army's arrival, but please do take<<CRLF>>this time to recover your strength.

#10100FI apologize for any disturbance from the<<CRLF>>Romun Army's arrival, but please do take<<CRLF>>this time to recover your strength.
#10103F...I must say, I continue to be deeply<<CRLF>>impressed by your progress.<<CRLF>>
#10103FYou may be at a standstill now, but I<<CRLF>>have faith that you can overcome it.<<CRLF>>
#10100FAh, greetings. It appears your<<CRLF>>exploration of the Great Forest is pro-<<CRLF>>gressing smoothly.
#10100FBut...you've found something significant,<<CRLF>>I trust? May I ask for details?<<CRLF>>
#00109F...Whoa, how did you work that out?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FWe haven't said a word yet!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FMm. I suppose you could call it a lucky<<CRLF>>hunch.<<CRLF>>
#10103FWould you be willing to share your findings<<CRLF>>with me? You need only tell me whatever<<CRLF>>you're comfortable with.
#00100F(Well, Commander Leo's already gotten<<CRLF>>that far too.)<<CRLF>>
#00100F(Telling her we've found a village shouldn't<<CRLF>>cause any problems.)<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol told Governor General Griselda that they had discovered a<<CRLF>>village built around a large tree.<<CRLF>>
#10108FInteresting. That's a significant find indeed.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FWhile I would like to know about it in<<CRLF>>more detail, the mere discovery that such<<CRLF>>a place exists is quite a development.
#10103FIt seems my expectations in you were not<<CRLF>>misplaced.<<CRLF>>
#10103FI'll be eagerly awaiting your next report.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol told Governor General Griselda that they had discovered a<<CRLF>>village on the bank of the river.<<CRLF>>

#10103FIf you make any additional discoveries I<<CRLF>>would greatly appreciate being informed.<<CRLF>>
#10103FI'll be eagerly awaiting your next report.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FIt's said that those who enter the Great<<CRLF>>Forest never return alive.<<CRLF>>
#10100FI'm sure there will be many difficulties in<<CRLF>>your path, but I will be eagerly anticipating<<CRLF>>your next report.
#10100FI pray for your success and safe return.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FI'm most grateful for your efforts.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FI'm sure there will be many difficulties in<<CRLF>>your path, but I will be eagerly anticipating<<CRLF>>your next report.
#10100FEven now, I'm counting and recounting<<CRLF>>your reward, fully confident that it will be<<CRLF>>yours when the time comes. Godspeed!

Whether our enemy is Gruda or perhaps even<<CRLF>>Romn itself, the Governor General is true to<<CRLF>>her noble ideals.
...I intend to do everything in my power to<<CRLF>>support her.<<CRLF>>
There are a number of rumors floating around<<CRLF>>the city about the Primeval Lands.<<CRLF>>
Some of them are quite accurate, too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But there are so many, and all of them lack<<CRLF>>any hard proof, I doubt anyone will be able<<CRLF>>to sort the truth from the lies.
I can only hope the lies win out in the end!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There are so many theories, and all of them lack<<CRLF>>any hard proof, I doubt anyone will be able<<CRLF>>to sort the truth from the lies.
I can only hope the lies win out in the end!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The Masked Division sounds creepier and<<CRLF>>creepier the more I hear about it.<<CRLF>>
Involving common soldiers in such a thing is<<CRLF>>truly inhuman. Gruda shouldn't get off lightly<<CRLF>>for what he's done.
The assault on Highland was all Gruda's doing.<<CRLF>>He can only hope to get off on charges of<<CRLF>>insubordination, but my money's on treason.
He hadn't sent one single report about those<<CRLF>>creepy masks the Romun Army were forced to<<CRLF>>wear, either.
I thought he was suspicious, but I never<<CRLF>>expected him to do anything quite like this.<<CRLF>>He's a disgrace to Romn.
At least Highland has been placed under the<<CRLF>>Governor General's protection.<<CRLF>>
Not only will this prevent any further violence<<CRLF>>from occurring there, it should also stop any<<CRLF>>other intruders from getting in.

Not only will this prevent any further violence<<CRLF>>from occurring there, it should also stop other<<CRLF>>intruders from getting in.
Governor General Griselda is currently in<<CRLF>>the conference room, in a meeting with<<CRLF>>Commander Gruda.
The Romun Army's exploration of the Great<<CRLF>>Forest will be fully commencing soon.<<CRLF>>
You'd best be careful, unless you want them<<CRLF>>stealing all your glory.<<CRLF>>
The Romun Army's exploration of the Great<<CRLF>>Forest will be fully commencing soon.<<CRLF>>
You'd best be careful, unless you want them<<CRLF>>stealing all your glory.<<CRLF>>
I can't help but wonder about Gruda.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He doesn't seem to have any major achievements<<CRLF>>back in Romn, and yet he's been given control<<CRLF>>of the Romun Army forces here in Celceta...
How has he managed to attain such a prestigious<<CRLF>>position so quickly?<<CRLF>>
Hmm, it does seem your map is coming along<<CRLF>>well.<<CRLF>>
You're doing incredible work for someone your<<CRLF>>age. We really can't thank you enough.<<CRLF>>
Wars cost money -- and unimaginably huge<<CRLF>>amounts of it, at that.<<CRLF>>
So money gained from finding and mining new<<CRLF>>sources of gold ore here in Celceta is directly<<CRLF>>connected to ensuring our army's survival.
No matter what the locals might say about it,<<CRLF>>we have little choice but to enter the Great<<CRLF>>Forest if there's any chance of finding more.

No matter what the locals might say about it,<<CRLF>>we have little choice but to enter the Great<<CRLF>>Forest if there's any chance of finding more.
If you want to report your progress on the map,<<CRLF>>you should speak with the Governor General<<CRLF>>herself.
Normally, being allowed to visit the Governor<<CRLF>>General whenever you wish would be unthinkable.<<CRLF>>But, such are her orders.
So you're the warriors who defeated the monster<<CRLF>>in the mines, are you?<<CRLF>>
Allow me to thank you for your efforts as well.<<CRLF>>We're greatly indebted to you.<<CRLF>>
Both the Governor General and her adjutant are<<CRLF>>a bit frightening these days.<<CRLF>>
I need to be sure I don't mess up!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This is just a rumor I heard back in Romn,<<CRLF>>but...<<CRLF>>
Apparently over the past few years, a secret<<CRLF>>organization was formed within the Romun Army<<CRLF>>to investigate the mysteries of ancient ruins.
If someone told me Gruda was part of that<<CRLF>>organization, I could definitely believe it.<<CRLF>>
...But, I probably said too much, didn't I?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Especially as these kinds of rumors usually<<CRLF>>have no basis in reality. So...please forget<<CRLF>>I said anything.
Okay, time to stop talking and get working!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm actually a lot busier than I look, you<<CRLF>>know.<<CRLF>>
*sip*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm still a coffee man, but tea isn't bad once<<CRLF>>in a while either.<<CRLF>>
...Even in this building, only a small number<<CRLF>>know about the Primeval Lands.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure you've been told this over and over<<CRLF>>already, but be careful talking about it<<CRLF>>around the city.
*sip*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Aah, drinking coffee in the guard room really<<CRLF>>is the best!<<CRLF>>
Guard duty is shift-based. So we each have to<<CRLF>>work during a specific time period.<<CRLF>>
And my shift...starts far too soon.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
At least I'm almost done for the day!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Guess I should guard like I mean it till I'm<<CRLF>>off the clock.<<CRLF>>
Office work really makes your neck stiffen up<<CRLF>>after a while.<<CRLF>>
I suppose I should take a break.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The Celcetan Army is always short on soldiers.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Occasionally, us regulars have to take care of<<CRLF>>office work that would normally be handled by<<CRLF>>army officials.
Although, naturally, we can't leave tasks of<<CRLF>>a sensitive nature to any soldiers who've been<<CRLF>>conscripted from the local area.
So guess who ends up doing them.<<CRLF>>That's right...me. *sigh*<<CRLF>>
...It's not a job to envy, that's for sure.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* I wish there were more soldiers here from<<CRLF>>Romn.<<CRLF>>
...I want to be able to do easy work like the<<CRLF>>locals.<<CRLF>>
What's up? Hoping to join the army?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm sure you can tell just by looking, but this<<CRLF>>is our guard room.<<CRLF>>
There's nothing worth seeing here, so I wouldn't<<CRLF>>bother staying for very long. You might catch<<CRLF>>our cabin fever.

Hey, good evening...or, good afternoon, I guess?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*yawn* Ahhh, who cares.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Anyway, good morning...I mean, good night.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Anyway, good night. See you tomorrow.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Actually, when I wake up it'll still be<<CRLF>>today, so I suppose that should be 'see you<<CRLF>>later today'... I don't know. I give up!
Time for bed! BEDBEDBEDBEDBEDBEDBEDBED!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...So, can you get out of my room, please?<<CRLF>>I can't sleep with you mucking about in here.<<CRLF>>
*yawn* So tired... Good night...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Oh, wait, I'm not in bed yet.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. Oops. I almost fell asleep standing up!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My deadliest foe...is the sun.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...So I'm going to sleep. Good night!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder what it is about the dark of night that<<CRLF>>scares people.<<CRLF>>
Whenever I'm out at night, I always end up<<CRLF>>imagining things that can't possibly be there.<<CRLF>>
The more night patrols you do, the more your<<CRLF>>eyes adjust to the darkness.<<CRLF>>
I'm so used to it now that the sunlight during<<CRLF>>the day is too bright, and I find myself<<CRLF>>greatly preferring the indoors.
Okay, time for me to sleep the day away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, can you not disturb me? I'm about to go to<<CRLF>>sleep.<<CRLF>>
I'm about to go to sleep, so...can you go away?<<CRLF>>Please?<<CRLF>>
*yawn* It's hard being in charge of the night<<CRLF>>patrol.<<CRLF>>

Hand over Honey Potion x3
Cancel
I need three Honey Potions. Thanks.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll be waiting for you here when you're done<<CRLF>>buying them.<<CRLF>>
Thanks. Where are they?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Come on, stop messing around and bring me my<<CRLF>>Honey Potions!<<CRLF>>
Nothing goes with food better than a good<<CRLF>>Honey Potion! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
*gulp* *gulp* Ah, this is heavenly!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *chew*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mmm... This is quite delicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *chew*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mmm... This is...passable.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *chew*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mmm... This is pretty delicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *chew*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mmm... This is...kind of delicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *chew*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mmm... This is mildly delicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *chew*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mmm... This is...somewhat delicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *chew*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mmm... This is fairly delicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *chew*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mmm... This is...moderately delicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There really is more to cooking than meets the<<CRLF>>eye.<<CRLF>>
I believe that's what makes it such a noble<<CRLF>>pursuit!<<CRLF>>
I didn't manage to season the food as well<<CRLF>>today as I usually do.<<CRLF>>
I wonder if Wallace will be able to tell.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I feel like today's food turned out better than<<CRLF>>usual.<<CRLF>>
I wonder if Wallace will be able to tell.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How did I end up being left in charge of the<<CRLF>>cooking, anyway?<<CRLF>>
It was supposed to work on a rotation. Can't<<CRLF>>someone at least help me out?<<CRLF>>
The Romun Army soldiers sure do eat a lot.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Still, as the person who cooks the food,<<CRLF>>I'll take that as a compliment.<<CRLF>>
Thanks to the Romun Army's arrival, I'm twice<<CRLF>>as busy as usual lately.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* It's a royal pain!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wallace is always sitting there munching away,<<CRLF>>as if he's completely forgotten there's anyone<<CRLF>>else in the room.
Didn't anyone ever teach him table manners?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My cooking seems to have gained a reputation<<CRLF>>for being 'pretty okay.'<<CRLF>>
It's not really that great of a compliment, but<<CRLF>>I suppose it's better than 'not bad.'<<CRLF>>
*munch* *munch* *munch*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you're gonna eat, you've gotta eat until<<CRLF>>you're full.<<CRLF>>
Gotta fill myself up while I still can!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *munch* *munch*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm gonna eat! I'm gonna eat until my stomach<<CRLF>>can't take no more!<<CRLF>>
*munch* *munch* *munch*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
As soon as we enter the forest, it's going to be<<CRLF>>camping all the way, so I'm not going to be able<<CRLF>>to have a good meal again for a long time.
So I've got to eat as much as possible while<<CRLF>>I still can!<<CRLF>>
*munch* *munch* *munch*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm gonna eat! I'm gonna eat until my stomach<<CRLF>>can't take no more!<<CRLF>>
Right, then, I should probably check the route<<CRLF>>through the forest again.<<CRLF>>
There's no chance of it actually happening, but<<CRLF>>I sure wouldn't want to be beaten by those<<CRLF>>Celcetan Army soldiers!
The Celcetan General Government Building is<<CRLF>>surprisingly well-equipped.<<CRLF>>
I'm a bit worried about the lack of morale in<<CRLF>>the soldiers here...but nonetheless, this place<<CRLF>>would still get a passing score from me.

#10105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12SExcuse me, Governor General.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10009FGovernor General?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FOh, it's you, Leo.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FMy apologies. I was lost in thought.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FI admit I am somewhat surprised upon<<CRLF>>hearing that you, of all people, became<<CRLF>>the Governor General of Celceta.
#10001FI'd never expected to find the fourth<<CRLF>>princess of the Imperial Romun Empire<<CRLF>>herself in a place like...this.
#10100FPlease don't call me that. Here, I'm to<<CRLF>>be regarded solely as Governor General<<CRLF>>Griselda.
#10105FBesides, I've been scorned by the Empire<<CRLF>>in much the same way you have...<<CRLF>>
#10101F...Roaring Leo.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FI see.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FBut I have no intention of looking back<<CRLF>>upon my past with shame.<<CRLF>>
#10105FI firmly believe there must be a task that<<CRLF>>only we can complete here in this land.<<CRLF>>
#10103FWhatever that task may be, I'll be count-<<CRLF>>ing on you, Commander Leo.<<CRLF>>
#10005FYes, ma'am! I am honored.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp1301.JSON_TEXT 179 >>
Whoa, hold up, now!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0M*sigh* I step away from you for just a few<<CRLF>>minutes and find you wandering in here alone?<<CRLF>>
#0MWhere do you think you're going?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I heard a strange voice.
C-calm down, and stay back...
#00110FYou sure you weren't just hearing things?<<CRLF>>You obviously suffered a blow to the head<<CRLF>>if you wound up with amnesia!
#00105FOh, no, I'm not letting this go! Am I just<<CRLF>>supposed to look the other way while you<<CRLF>>go and get yourself killed?! Huh-uh!
#4CAdol explained to Duren what happened at the mine entrance.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FI think I get it now. You're one of<<CRLF>>THOSE people, aren't you?<<CRLF>>
#00101FNothing I hate more in this whole wide<<CRLF>>world than you naive, meddlesome little<<CRLF>>do-gooders!
#00105FYou just have to try and solve everyone<<CRLF>>else's problems, and you drag others<<CRLF>>down with you while you're doing it!
#00111F...Well, I know better than to try and<<CRLF>>talk your kind out of these crazy stunts,<<CRLF>>but if you must go, at least take this.
#00111FI don't want your corpse on my<<CRLF>>conscience!<<CRLF>>
#00101FI can't believe you were seriously<<CRLF>>thinking of wandering in here<<CRLF>>bare-handed...
#00110F...Come to think of it, if you've lost<<CRLF>>all your memories, does that mean you've<<CRLF>>forgotten how to fight, too?!
I think I can manage.
...Maybe.
#00111F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...That's really not something you should<<CRLF>>be saying with a straight face. Especially<<CRLF>>not in a mine full of monsters.
#00102F#16SFINE! I'll come part of the way<<CRLF>>with you.<<CRLF>>
#00102FOnly part of the way, though,<<CRLF>>you got it?<<CRLF>>
Thanks.
Now who's being naive?
#00105FS-sure... Come on. Let's get going.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FShut it, you!<<CRLF>>Let's just get this over with.<<CRLF>>
#4CDuren joined the party.
Hey there, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you saw my request on the board,<<CRLF>>no?<<CRLF>>
Man, I really appreciate you, of all people,<<CRLF>>agreeing to help us out.<<CRLF>>
So how about it? You ready to lend a hand?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey Adol, you able to give me a hand yet?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Accept
Not right now
Thanks, I really appreciate it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Right, then let's get to it! I'll show you where<<CRLF>>I want you to work.<<CRLF>>
Oh, you've got something else to take care of?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No worries, then. Come back when you can.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No worries, then. Come back when you can.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Nice job, Adol. Did you get a good workout?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All right, then, let's see how you did.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out nine pieces of ore in<<CRLF>>total.<<CRLF>>
Hmm... Should be plenty!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out eight pieces of ore in<<CRLF>>total.<<CRLF>>
Hmm... Should be plenty!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out seven pieces of ore in<<CRLF>>total.<<CRLF>>
Hmm... Should be plenty!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out six pieces of ore in<<CRLF>>total.<<CRLF>>
Not half bad for a first go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out five pieces of ore in<<CRLF>>total.<<CRLF>>
Not half bad for a first go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out four pieces of ore in<<CRLF>>total.<<CRLF>>
Not half bad for a first go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out three pieces of ore in<<CRLF>>total.<<CRLF>>
I was hoping for a little more, to be honest.<<CRLF>>But I suppose this is your first time.<<CRLF>>
Anyway, here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out two pieces of ore in<<CRLF>>total.<<CRLF>>
I was hoping for a little more, to be honest.<<CRLF>>But I suppose this is your first time.<<CRLF>>
Anyway, here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out one single piece of ore.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I was hoping for more than that, to be honest.<<CRLF>>But I suppose this is your first time.<<CRLF>>
Anyway, here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm...so you weren't able to dig out any ore<<CRLF>>at all?<<CRLF>>
Sorry, I can't give you any reward for that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you dug out ten pieces of ore.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Frankly, I'm kind of amazed! I didn't think<<CRLF>>you'd be able to manage that many.<<CRLF>>
Well, here's your reward. Threw in a bonus,<<CRLF>>too!<<CRLF>>
...Hmm? Something else on your mind?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ask about the Primeval Lands
Ask about the tower
Primeval Lands? ...Sorry, never heard of it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I did hear someone discovered a village in<<CRLF>>the forest recently, if you can believe that!<<CRLF>>
...Wait, that was you, wasn't it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
A tower? There's a tower in the forest?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I know you can see a huge tree, but I've never<<CRLF>>heard of anyone seeing a tower...<<CRLF>>
Oh yeah, I did hear someone discovered a<<CRLF>>village in the forest recently, if you can believe<<CRLF>>that!
...Wait, that was you, wasn't it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You just never stop blowing people's minds.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sorry I can't be any more helpful, but good<<CRLF>>luck finding whatever it is you're looking for.<<CRLF>>
And thanks again for your help!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Miners Wanted'!
If I ever need anything else, I'll be calling on<<CRLF>>you for sure. Great work today.<<CRLF>>
#3CFailed the quest 'Miners Wanted'...
The closer we get to the forest, the more<<CRLF>>dangerous it gets. But there do seem to be<<CRLF>>more ore veins, just like we always heard.
Either way, we're going to keep mining<<CRLF>>here until the Romuns tell us to stop.<<CRLF>>
This mine should be secure for a while.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We've got to make money here for as long as<<CRLF>>we can.<<CRLF>>
Hmm... Don't seem to be getting anywhere with<<CRLF>>my work today.<<CRLF>>
On days like this, sometimes you just have to<<CRLF>>throw in the towel and try again tomorrow.<<CRLF>>
A lot of the ruins we've unearthed have had<<CRLF>>statues in them of some kind of winged god.<<CRLF>>
No clue who it's supposed to be, though.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mining's not as simple as some people think.<<CRLF>>Just dig all over the place and you're not<<CRLF>>likely to find much.
Naturally, luck is a factor, but experience and<<CRLF>>instinct play a huge part as well.<<CRLF>>
Thanks for your help today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mining tires you out pretty quickly if you're<<CRLF>>not used to it, no?<<CRLF>>
Just make sure you get some rest at the inn,<<CRLF>>though, and you'll be fine.<<CRLF>>
That Governor General's brought in a new<<CRLF>>regulation for us miners.<<CRLF>>
Apparently, if we unearth a ruin, or even part<<CRLF>>of one, we have to stop work immediately.<<CRLF>>
Then we have to leave everything exactly as it<<CRLF>>is and report to her. Crazy, isn't it?<<CRLF>>
This is gonna slow our work down something<<CRLF>>fierce. *sigh*<<CRLF>>
Oh well. Not like we can do anything about it!<<CRLF>>Just gotta do what we're told.<<CRLF>>
Honestly, doesn't she realize how many ruins<<CRLF>>there are in Celceta? They're all over the<<CRLF>>damned place!
This is gonna slow our work down something<<CRLF>>fierce.<<CRLF>>
Hey there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks again for the help yesterday.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The area beyond here is dangerous, so we've<<CRLF>>sealed it off for now...but I'm sure you'll be<<CRLF>>fine.
You're on your own, though, from here on out.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hate to say it, but we can't come and help you<<CRLF>>if anything happens.<<CRLF>>
Not gonna stop you if you wanna pass, but make<<CRLF>>sure you're well-prepared.<<CRLF>>
Hate to say it, but we can't come and help you<<CRLF>>if anything happens.<<CRLF>>
Good to hear that there's still money to be made<<CRLF>>from this mine.<<CRLF>>
I've worked in a few mines before ending up<<CRLF>>here, and I'll tell you, there aren't many<<CRLF>>where the ore is quite this plentiful.
We've found another vein.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All right, time to get digging!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We do have days like this around here sometimes.<<CRLF>>Days where no one's heart really seems to be in<<CRLF>>their work.
We stumbled on another ruin, so we're stopping<<CRLF>>everything for the moment.<<CRLF>>
Bah. We're not getting anywhere, and this isn't<<CRLF>>helping!<<CRLF>>
Everything the head miner says has a lot of<<CRLF>>meaning behind it. He's as wise as the day<<CRLF>>is long! That's why he's the head miner.
I hope he teaches me the ropes and makes me<<CRLF>>as great as he is someday.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* I wish I'd get off work already so<<CRLF>>I could go get a drink.<<CRLF>>
Governor Griselda's way of thinking seems to be<<CRLF>>totally different from all the previous Governor<<CRLF>>Generals'.
All her predecessors just told us to dig as hard<<CRLF>>as we could, ruins be damned.<<CRLF>>
Monsters are still showing up in that tunnel<<CRLF>>where we found the ruin.<<CRLF>>
We've also been told that the Romuns will be<<CRLF>>taking control of the ruin itself, so we're not<<CRLF>>to mess with it.
Either way, we're just leaving that whole route<<CRLF>>be for now.<<CRLF>>
Oh well. Just gotta put all that behind us and<<CRLF>>get back to work!<<CRLF>>
That ruin tunnel? We're just leaving that whole<<CRLF>>route be for now.<<CRLF>>
Oh well. Just gotta put all that behind us and<<CRLF>>get back to work!<<CRLF>>

#00101FThis is a pretty old-looking monument.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00101FWhat did you just do?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't know.
I only touched it.
#00101FOh... Yeah, I suppose you wouldn't.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FLooks like it's been buried here for<<CRLF>>a long time.<<CRLF>>
#00105FOh well, let's just focus on getting out<<CRLF>>of here. No time to be worrying about old<<CRLF>>statues!
#00101FYeah...I guess that is all you did.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FLooks like it's been buried here for a<<CRLF>>long time.<<CRLF>>
#00105FOh well, let's just focus on getting out<<CRLF>>of here. No time to be worrying about old<<CRLF>>statues!
#00100FHold on. We're both gonna look pretty<<CRLF>>bad if we leave now.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's head farther inside.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sorry, this is off-limits right now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CIt would be best to return to town.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FWh-what? What just happened?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FThis is the entrance to the mine, isn't it?<<CRLF>>How'd we get here?<<CRLF>>
#00109F...Did that monument warp us here?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FSo many weird things have happened<<CRLF>>today, it's making my head hurt!<<CRLF>>
#00111FCome on. Let's just get back to town<<CRLF>>already.<<CRLF>>
<< mp1302.JSON_TEXT 43 >>
#00109FYeah, these are monsters, all right!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* What're they doing this close to<<CRLF>>the entrance?<<CRLF>>
#00101FHow does it feel to hold a sword again,<<CRLF>>Adol?<<CRLF>>
#00101FSo how does it feel to hold a sword<<CRLF>>again?<<CRLF>>
It feels pretty natural.
It's a little heavy.
#00100FOh? That's good to hear.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FOkay, try taking these monsters<<CRLF>>on by yourself to start with.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThey seem pretty weak, so they should<<CRLF>>make for a nice warm-up.<<CRLF>>
#00111F...I'm really starting to worry about you,<<CRLF>>you know.<<CRLF>>
#00101FTry taking these monsters on by yourself<<CRLF>>to start with. They seem pretty weak, so<<CRLF>>they should be a perfect warm-up.
#00101FAnd if you can't even handle that, then<<CRLF>>I'm so done with you!<<CRLF>>
#00111F...You still haven't equipped that sword I<<CRLF>>gave you?!<<CRLF>>
#00111FHurry up and equip it already, dammit!<<CRLF>>Don't let my present to go to waste!<<CRLF>>
#00100FLooks like your body remembers<<CRLF>>how to use a sword, even if your<<CRLF>>brain doesn't.
#00100FAwesome! You learned a skill in that<<CRLF>>fight, too.<<CRLF>>
#00100FMake sure you equip it before we move<<CRLF>>on, though. You can only use skills when<<CRLF>>you've got them equipped.
#00111FHold on, weren't you listening?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FIf you don't equip that skill before we<<CRLF>>move on, you won't be able to use it in<<CRLF>>battle!
All right, what I'd like you to do is mine this<<CRLF>>area.<<CRLF>>
Look familiar? It should. This is where that<<CRLF>>monster appeared before.<<CRLF>>
Because of that, it's too risky for us regular<<CRLF>>miners to dig here, and we were forced to aban-<<CRLF>>don it. But you're a whole other story, Adol!
Anyway, getting down to business...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I want you to use this pickaxe to dig out as<<CRLF>>much ore as you can in the time provided.<<CRLF>>
Naturally, gold is the ore I'm most interested in.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm not going to give you a specific amount to<<CRLF>>dig, but you'll be paid based on how much you're<<CRLF>>able to mine, so...well, go for the gold!
#911cThe more gold ore you dig out, the more money<<CRLF>>you'll get. So give it everything you've got!<<CRLF>>
Oh, and anything other than gold ore doesn't<<CRLF>>count, so you're free to take it with you.<<CRLF>>Finders keepers!
In effect, the more you dig, the more you get.<<CRLF>>So the bottom line is, keep digging. Don't stop<<CRLF>>for anything!
...I think that should about cover matters.<<CRLF>>Did you get all that?<<CRLF>>
I sure did.
Would you explain again?
Excellent.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, then...let's see what you've got!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm, well then...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I want you to use this pickaxe to dig out as<<CRLF>>much ore as you can in the time provided.<<CRLF>>
Naturally, gold is the ore I'm most interested<<CRLF>>in.<<CRLF>>

#4CDig up as much gold ore as possible\nwithin the time limit!
<< mp1303.JSON_TEXT 16 >>
#00109FThese monsters aren't gonna be as<<CRLF>>easy to deal with as the last lot.<<CRLF>>
#00101FMy strike attacks aren't too effective<<CRLF>>against soft-bodied creatures like these...<<CRLF>>
#00101FBut your sword's slash attacks should<<CRLF>>do the job nicely.<<CRLF>>
#00101FOn the other hand, those tough-looking<<CRLF>>ones over there might repel your sword...<<CRLF>>
#00101FBut my fists and kicks can smash 'em<<CRLF>>up good!<<CRLF>>
#00100FIn other words, we've both got enemies<<CRLF>>we're strong against and enemies we're<<CRLF>>weak against.
#00100FYou focus on monsters weak to slash<<CRLF>>attacks, and I'll focus on ones weak<<CRLF>>to strike attacks, got it?
#00100FYou starting to get the hang of fighting<<CRLF>>again?<<CRLF>>
#00100FOh, and just in case you need it, I'll<<CRLF>>give you one of these.<<CRLF>>
What is it?
*blush* You're so thoughtful!

#10505F#0940VStop whining or the Commander's gonna<<CRLF>>yell at us when he gets back.<<CRLF>>
#10604F#0956VEeeek! Go away! Shoo! Shoo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We're here to help!
This doesn't concern us. Let's just go.
#10509FPanza, someone's come to help us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FHeeeeelp!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* I guess we can't just leave them.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FOut of all the monsters we've fought<<CRLF>>so far, these look like the toughest.<<CRLF>>
#00101FJust think of this as a chance to<<CRLF>>review everything you've learned.<<CRLF>>Give 'em all you've got!
#00111FC'mon! You were the one who ran<<CRLF>>over here first! You can't just turn tail<<CRLF>>and flee now!

#10604FI thought I was gonna die!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505FOh, come on, now you're just<<CRLF>>exaggerating.<<CRLF>>
#10500FBy the way, who are you two?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FOh, just a passing information dealer<<CRLF>>and his amnesiac do-gooder companion.<<CRLF>>
#00100FYou two might not be any kind of<<CRLF>>match for what's in here. You'd do well<<CRLF>>to head back.
#10604FSanchooo... Let's do that! I don't think<<CRLF>>I can go on. My leg still hurts.<<CRLF>>
#10604FI knew I wasn't cut out to be a soldier...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505F...Suppose we might as well leave for<<CRLF>>now. He's not going to be any use<<CRLF>>like this.

#00105FThe Celcetan Army's technically part of<<CRLF>>Romn's armed forces, but it's made up<<CRLF>>more of locals than trained Romuns.
#00105F...As you can see, morale isn't exactly<<CRLF>>high.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat means it's our time to shine! Let's<<CRLF>>keep moving.<<CRLF>>
<< mp1305.JSON_TEXT 20 >>
#00109FDamn, looks like it's locked.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CHe's right. The gate is definitely locked up tight.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FNope. It's not budging.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FDon't think there's any other way to<<CRLF>>go deeper into the mine, though...<<CRLF>>
Let's look for the key.
Let's try forcing it open.
#00100FYeah, sounds like a plan. There's<<CRLF>>gotta be a key somewhere nearby.<<CRLF>>
#00101FThat'll be plan B, but with a lock this<<CRLF>>well-made, it's a lot easier said than<<CRLF>>done.
#00100FI think we should have a look around<<CRLF>>and see if the key's anywhere nearby<<CRLF>>before we start bustin' up the place.
#4CThe chest is locked up tight.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FThis too?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHmm... Still, this is a much simpler<<CRLF>>lock than the one on the gate.<<CRLF>>
#00100FNo problem. Leave it to me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FLooks like that did the trick.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FRight, then, let's go get that gate open<<CRLF>>and see what's waiting for us behind it!<<CRLF>>

#00109FOh boy, what now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...Is it resonating with that stone<<CRLF>>monument?<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's take a closer look.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00109FHuh, this place feels a lot different<<CRLF>>from the rest of the mine...<<CRLF>>
#00109FIt's like some kind of old ruin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FIs this the monster that started all the<<CRLF>>trouble?!<<CRLF>>
#00102FWatch out, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102FIf you don't wanna die, you'd better<<CRLF>>hurry up and remember how to fight!<<CRLF>>
#00100FWhew, that was close.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FBut man, I've gotta say, you're pretty<<CRLF>>strong!<<CRLF>>
#00103FYou might've lost your memories, but<<CRLF>>I'm starting to see how you were able<<CRLF>>to make it out of that forest alive.
No one's more surprised than I am.
Oh, that was nothing!
#00111F...And yet you came wandering in here<<CRLF>>without a sword?<<CRLF>>
#00111FHopeless doesn't even begin to describe<<CRLF>>you...<<CRLF>>
#00111FDon't give me that. You look as shocked<<CRLF>>as I am.<<CRLF>>
#00111FBeing naive is bad enough, but naive<<CRLF>>AND reckless? You're not gonna live<<CRLF>>long if you keep that up!
Man's Voice
You two!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I couldn't believe my eyes! You actually<<CRLF>>managed to take down that huge monster!<<CRLF>>
I'm Wagner, the head miner.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm so glad you're okay.
I'm just a passing philanthropist...
I can't thank you enough. You literally<<CRLF>>saved all our lives from certain doom!<<CRLF>>
Huh? ...Haha. You're a loopy one! But that<<CRLF>>just makes you all the more interesting.<<CRLF>>
Still, thank you so very much for your help.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
As long as that monster was there, we had<<CRLF>>nowhere to go.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAt least none of you are too worse<<CRLF>>for wear. Thank goodness for small<<CRLF>>favors, I guess!
Absolutely. I'm eternally grateful that no one<<CRLF>>was hurt. Although...there is something worth<<CRLF>>noting that occurred just in the next area.
See, there's a strange statue there, and at<<CRLF>>one point, it started to glow...and that seemed<<CRLF>>to calm the monsters a bit.
It might've just been my imagination, but...<<CRLF>>I could swear it actually happened.<<CRLF>>
What kind of statue?
What kind of ruin is this?
What kind of statue? Hmm... Well, it had wings<<CRLF>>on its back. Very distinct.<<CRLF>>
Sometimes we end up unearthing remnants<<CRLF>>of old ruins when digging tunnels around<<CRLF>>here.
Unfortunately, that means we also sometimes<<CRLF>>end up unearthing monsters like that thing...<<CRLF>>
#00109FYou look like you wanna see it<<CRLF>>even more now, Adol. <<CRLF>>
If you're that interested, you should go take<<CRLF>>a look for yourself.<<CRLF>>
We, on the other hand, should be leaving. I'm<<CRLF>>thinking everyone's quite worried about us<<CRLF>>by now!
#00103FSure thing. Take care of yourselves.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo, you're into these kinds of places,<<CRLF>>huh?<<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, we're here anyway, so we might<<CRLF>>as well take a quick look around.<<CRLF>>
#00109FHey, what's that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FIs that the statue Wagner was talking<<CRLF>>about?<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol was suddenly stricken with a violent, intense headache.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FHey, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FYou okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...Was it that voice you heard outside<<CRLF>>again?<<CRLF>>
#00101FYou don't look so good. I think it's about<<CRLF>>time we head out of here ourselves!<<CRLF>>
#4CSuddenly, a light appeared before the two, concealing a small,<<CRLF>>winged object within it.<<CRLF>>
#00108FWhoa, that sure wasn't here before!<<CRLF>>Where the hell did it come from?!<<CRLF>>
#00109FSure looks old... I wonder what it was<<CRLF>>used for.<<CRLF>>
#00109FDo you think this ruin has anything to<<CRLF>>do with the voice you heard?<<CRLF>>
I don't know...
Calm down.
#00105FW-well, yeah, I guess you wouldn't...<<CRLF>>Sorry.<<CRLF>>
#00105FS-sorry... I guess without your memories<<CRLF>>there's no way you'd know.<<CRLF>>
#00101FI know that when miners dig up ruins,<<CRLF>>monsters sometimes show up, or other<<CRLF>>strange things start to happen.
#00101FSeems like this is just another unsolved<<CRLF>>mining mystery for the history books.<<CRLF>>
#00100F...Well, I'm ready to go any time. When<<CRLF>>you're done down here, let's head back<<CRLF>>to the surface.
#00100FWe're here, so we might as well take<<CRLF>>a look around.<<CRLF>>
#00100FMaybe we'll find some treasure or<<CRLF>>something.<<CRLF>>

#00101FSure you already know this, but this is<<CRLF>>when the real danger starts. Not many<<CRLF>>go past this and live to tell about it.
#00105FIt's bad enough you lose your sense of<<CRLF>>direction, but then you also lose your<<CRLF>>sense of time on top of that.
#00105FAnd the beasts in here know all kinds of<<CRLF>>dangerous tricks, so you'd better watch<<CRLF>>out for being poisoned and stuff, too.
#00100FStill, you made it out of here alive once<<CRLF>>before on your own...<<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd this time, you've got me with you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo, what the hell, right? Let's dive in and<<CRLF>>see what we can find. Just make sure you<<CRLF>>pace yourself, and we'll be fine!

#16S#00941VYes, sir!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FReminds me of a story I heard at the bar<<CRLF>>once.<<CRLF>>
#00105FSeems he was a pretty famous general at<<CRLF>>one point. People used to call him 'Roaring<<CRLF>>Leo.'
#00111FI dunno what he's doing in Celceta, but<<CRLF>>he's got enough enthusiasm and energy<<CRLF>>for the whole army.
#00100FAnyway...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FMight be a good idea for us to head back<<CRLF>>to Casnan ourselves.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLooks like we've finished the map as far<<CRLF>>as the river. And something's obviously<<CRLF>>got the army all fired up over there...
#00100FPlus, we should probably report in with<<CRLF>>the Governor General. So what do you<<CRLF>>say? Head back to the city?
Okay.
I want to go somewhere else first.
#00103FAll right. Onward to Casnan, then!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FReally?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#12003FI'm kind of jealous of how free-spirited<<CRLF>>you are, to be honest...<<CRLF>>
#12009FMe, go out hunting?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12003FHaha... Surely you jest! If I were to be<<CRLF>>injured in the forest, I would no longer<<CRLF>>be able to play the harp!

#12001FNo one hunts in this area of the forest.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12001FAnd whoever it was had a most bizarre<<CRLF>>mask on. You saw it, didn't you?<<CRLF>>
#12001FNo, I don't think so...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12001F...Of course, it could've been someone<<CRLF>>from the village, but...there's no way for<<CRLF>>me to be certain.
#12001FWhoever it was was wearing a very<<CRLF>>unusual mask.<<CRLF>>
What kind of mask?
I couldn't see it.
#12001FI couldn't see it very well myself.<<CRLF>>His...or perhaps her movements were<<CRLF>>extremely quick.
#12001FAh, true. I suppose you wouldn't be able<<CRLF>>to see much from your vantage point.<<CRLF>>
#12004FBut it was...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000F...Oh, never mind. I'm sure it was<<CRLF>>nothing.<<CRLF>>
#12000FIt might have been part of a ritual.<<CRLF>>I'll ask Father when he gets back.<<CRLF>>

#00109FAnd you had no idea who this person<<CRLF>>was, right? Probably not anyone from<<CRLF>>Selray, then.

#00111F*sigh* Oh boy...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16SThis isn't even worth wasting the chief's<<CRLF>>time. We can handle this ourselves!<<CRLF>>
#16SOn my honor as a warrior of the forest, I<<CRLF>>will make you pay!<<CRLF>>
#00110FW-wait a minute! At least hear us out!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00110FHe doesn't remember coming here! He<<CRLF>>doesn't even remember anything about<<CRLF>>himself!
#00110FWe came here to help him try and get<<CRLF>>his memories back!<<CRLF>>
#16SYou honestly think we're going to believe<<CRLF>>that?!<<CRLF>>
#16SWhat sorts of fools do you take us for?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FD-damn... I think that just made things<<CRLF>>worse.<<CRLF>>
#00105FAdol, I think we're going to have to...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#18S#0250VHold it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ah...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
K-Karna?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wh-when did you get here?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F#0251V...You've...lost your memories?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F#0252VThe Adol I know would never make up<<CRLF>>an excuse like that to get out of trouble.<<CRLF>>
#00202F#0253VDoes that mean you've forgotten me,<<CRLF>>too?<<CRLF>>
Sorry...
It's not an excuse. It's the truth.
#00201F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206FHmph... You don't remember when we<<CRLF>>first met, then, either?<<CRLF>>
#00206FI was out hunting and attacked you,<<CRLF>>thinking you were a wild beast...but instead<<CRLF>>of getting angry, you apologized!
#00200FIt was my fault, but you said you were<<CRLF>>sorry for 'getting in the way'...<<CRLF>>
#00201F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204F*sigh* Don't look at me with those doe<<CRLF>>eyes.<<CRLF>>
#00204FYou're like a pure-hearted young boy.<<CRLF>>Honest to a fault.<<CRLF>>
#00200FI still can't believe you're a tough enough<<CRLF>>warrior to survive out in that forest.<<CRLF>>
Karna, are...are you actually thinking of trusting<<CRLF>>him?<<CRLF>>
#00200F...I don't know yet.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FBut either way, we should hear these<<CRLF>>two out. We owe them at least that much.<<CRLF>>
Y-you're going to let them into the village, at<<CRLF>>a time like this?!<<CRLF>>
#00200F...I know you're all on edge right now.<<CRLF>>And I completely understand.<<CRLF>>
#00200FMy family's been hit too, after all.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Th-that's right. I'm sorry...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FIt's a difficult time for everyone here,<<CRLF>>but that's all the more reason we need<<CRLF>>to stay calm and rational.
#00200FJust like this great tree that watches over<<CRLF>>everyone in Comodo...<<CRLF>>
#00200F...Otherwise, we'll end up making<<CRLF>>decisions we regret later.<<CRLF>>
Sorry. You're right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's just as you say, Karna.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FLook over there, Adol. You can see the<<CRLF>>whole forest from here. Every little thing<<CRLF>>we explored is in that sea of trees!
#00203FYes, yes, it's a lovely view, but keep<<CRLF>>walking. Your presence here is making<<CRLF>>the villagers very nervous, you know!
#00101F...Looks like the villagers are patrolling<<CRLF>>outside.<<CRLF>>
#00101FCan't really go around asking people for<<CRLF>>information, considering the situation...<<CRLF>>
#00100FBut let's see if we can find anything that<<CRLF>>might help you get some of your memories<<CRLF>>back.
#00100FHey, Adol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHow about we try sneaking around the<<CRLF>>village a little on the way out?<<CRLF>>
#00105FWe might, you know...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FWe might find something to help you get<<CRLF>>some of your memories back.<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol's base STR increased by 1.
#00109FAdol... Hey, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou okay? Did you remember something?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FThere you are, Adol! Honestly, I've been<<CRLF>>looking all over the place for you!<<CRLF>>
#00109FUh-oh, she's found us...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FHow'd you manage to get out? No wild<<CRLF>>beast's ever broken free of those<<CRLF>>bindings, much less a human being!
#00201FI'm quite proud of my trapping skills,<<CRLF>>too... You'll have to teach me how you<<CRLF>>did it sometime!
#00201FCome on, now, how many times do I<<CRLF>>have to drag you back before you give<<CRLF>>up?
#00201FIt's not easy being the one sheltering<<CRLF>>you. Everyone else would just as soon<<CRLF>>see you skinned alive!
#00109FWhoa, what's going on over there?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FWhat do you think you're doing?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12109F#16SUgh!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SFather!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FHe's...a match for Father? That can't<<CRLF>>be...<<CRLF>>
#12102F#16SHaaaaaaaaaaah!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FStay back, Karna! Their strength is highly<<CRLF>>abnormal!<<CRLF>>
#00101FWhat's with the masks?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FYou think they could have something to<<CRLF>>do with that masked man you and Remnos<<CRLF>>saw?
Seems like it.
I don't know.
#00101FYeah, too much of a coincidence to ignore.<<CRLF>>Still, I'd love to know what in the hell is<<CRLF>>going on around here!
#00101FWhy would the people of Comodo be<<CRLF>>attacking their own village?<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, I guess you did say you hadn't<<CRLF>>caught a very good glimpse of him...<<CRLF>>
#00101FStill, why would the people of Comodo be<<CRLF>>attacking their own village?<<CRLF>>
#00109FUh-oh, looks like there's more of 'em!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FYou... Are you the ones who've gone<<CRLF>>missing?<<CRLF>>
#12100FWhy...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105F...So you can't answer, then.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FRegardless, now that you have attacked<<CRLF>>our home...<<CRLF>>
#12100F...I cannot allow you to get away.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12109F(...! Impossible... It couldn't be...)<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FFather?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102FWe've come to help!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FAdol, Duren...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FStay back. I have no need of your<<CRLF>>assistance.<<CRLF>>
#00109FYou sure you're okay?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FStay back, I said!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12109F#16SUgh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SFather!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FDammit! They got away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAfter the masked assailants fled, Karna tended to the wounded<<CRLF>>villagers.<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol and Duren patrolled the surrounding area throughout the night,<<CRLF>>but the assailants did not return to attack again.<<CRLF>>
#4CAsad's wounds were deep, but after a long night of treatment,<<CRLF>>his life was no longer in danger.<<CRLF>>
#00200F...Seems their hideout's been uncovered.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHey, Karna. How's your dad doing?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FHe's through the worst of it. He'll be okay<<CRLF>>if he rests a while longer.<<CRLF>>
#00201FBut enough of that. I have something<<CRLF>>I'd like to discuss with you two.<<CRLF>>
#00109FWh-what is it? You look awfully serious...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI've decided to go and hunt for the masked men<<CRLF>>myself.<<CRLF>>
#00109F#0MBut...but didn't your dad say...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MStaying here at a time like this just doesn't<<CRLF>>suit me.<<CRLF>>
#00201FMy father's the strongest warrior here,<<CRLF>>yet he still lost the fight.<<CRLF>>
#00201FAnd if he can't win against them, what<<CRLF>>chance do the rest of us have? If they<<CRLF>>attack again, we're finished.
#00200FAt least if we can find their hideout, we'll<<CRLF>>be better equipped to deal with them.<<CRLF>>
#00109F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI'm no good at sitting around and weigh-<<CRLF>>ing my options. I much prefer standing tall<<CRLF>>and taking action.
#00200FI'd rather do something wrong and regret<<CRLF>>it later. At least then, I'll have done<<CRLF>>something.
#00100FYou're, uh...how do I put this? You're one<<CRLF>>tough little lady.<<CRLF>>
#00203FHeheh. Thanks.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FNaturally, you'll both be helping me, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FHuh? You've gotta be kidding me! First<<CRLF>>of all, I had nothing to do with any of this.<<CRLF>>Nothing!
#00111FYet I've been treated like a criminal,<<CRLF>>locked up, forced to patrol all night,<<CRLF>>eaten alive by mosquitoes...
We'll see this through to the end.
We've got a map to make anyway...
#00111FThis all started with you, Adol, so you're<<CRLF>>the last person I want to hear that from!<<CRLF>>
#00109F...The map?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, guess that's true. We'll have to go<<CRLF>>to wherever they're hiding eventually if<<CRLF>>we're gonna finish the map...
#00105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F#16SFine, FINE, I'll help, okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FMany thanks, to both of you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FNow, if that's settled, there's not a<<CRLF>>moment to waste.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWe have no idea when they'll attack next,<<CRLF>>so we'd better head out as quickly as<<CRLF>>possible.
#00100FLet's get all the provisions we need, then<<CRLF>>hit the road!<<CRLF>>
#4CKarna joined the party.
Hey, aren't you two...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Did you come about my request on the board?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FYeah. It said you want someone to teach<<CRLF>>you how to use a sword, right?<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo what do you think, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Um, would you be willing to teach me how to<<CRLF>>use a sword? Please?<<CRLF>>
Accept
Decline
Come on, please? Won't you reconsider?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol's got other things to do.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Don't be too pushy.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...You're right. But I'm not going to give up<<CRLF>>on this.<<CRLF>>
Even if I have to teach myself, I will learn how<<CRLF>>to use a sword! I swear!<<CRLF>>
Lindsay...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You really won't teach me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Well, I'm not going to give up!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Even if I have to teach myself, I will learn how<<CRLF>>to use a sword! I swear!<<CRLF>>
Lindsay...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Really?! Thank you so much!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* Looks like there's really no stopping<<CRLF>>her.<<CRLF>>
I appreciate you worrying about me, but I want<<CRLF>>to become stronger, no matter what.<<CRLF>>
Maybe I'm just doing it to satisfy my own ego.<<CRLF>>Maybe I'm just wasting my time, and this will<<CRLF>>all be for nothing.
But ever since that incident, I've really wanted<<CRLF>>to learn self-defense.<<CRLF>>
I shouldn't be okay with just sitting around in<<CRLF>>this village and doing nothing simply because<<CRLF>>I'm a girl, after all!
I don't expect to get as good as Karna, but<<CRLF>>I want to be able to hold my own, you know?<<CRLF>>
You're really serious about this, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Okay, fine. I understand.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If this is what you want, then go for it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FHmm. Well, you've definitely got the<<CRLF>>enthusiasm!<<CRLF>>
Actually...you know how to fight as well, don't<<CRLF>>you?<<CRLF>>
#00109FHmm? Yeah, I guess. I don't use a sword<<CRLF>>like Adol, though.<<CRLF>>
#00100FDo you want to learn to fight too?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI don't mind teaching you the art of<<CRLF>>hand-to-hand combat, if you want.<<CRLF>>
No, that's not why I was asking.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I was actually wondering...if I could ask you<<CRLF>>a favor?<<CRLF>>
#00101FHuh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Would the two of you be willing to have a duel,<<CRLF>>just to show us how it's done?<<CRLF>>
...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're curious about Adol's strength too,<<CRLF>>aren't you?<<CRLF>>
Besides, wouldn't it be best to see what a real<<CRLF>>swordsman can do before you start learning<<CRLF>>yourself?
Well...I guess that is true...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FYeah, that's actually not a half bad idea.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI've certainly got no objections.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHow about you, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou feel like testing yourself against<<CRLF>>these knockout knuckles?<<CRLF>>
I'd love to.
Sure you won't regret it?
#00100FPerfect!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAll right, then, may the best man win!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FHah! You say that as if I'm gonna lose!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe'll just see about that!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAll right, then, let's get this party started!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*gulp*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. This looks like it'll be quite an<<CRLF>>exciting battle!<<CRLF>>
Are you both ready?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah. Just give us the cue to start, and<<CRLF>>we'll be off.<<CRLF>>
Well then, get ready...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Aaaand...fight!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FOh man...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FI can't believe I lost...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That was a good fight.
Are you okay?
#00100FYeah, it was.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104F...Wait, are you just placating me?<<CRLF>>Hmph. Sore winner.<<CRLF>>
#00105FNot gonna make any excuses, though.<<CRLF>>You won, fair and square.<<CRLF>>
#00111FHah! Bad enough losing without having the<<CRLF>>winner worry about me.<<CRLF>>
#00105FBut I'll be a man and accept it. That was<<CRLF>>some good fighting, Adol.<<CRLF>>
Heheh. It's always interesting watching men talk<<CRLF>>amongst themselves.<<CRLF>>
You both did wonderfully.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yeah. I learned a lot just watching you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Me too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you for humoring my request.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here's a little something to show my<<CRLF>>appreciation.<<CRLF>>
Thank you for everything today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Sword Training'!
#00105F...Whew, looks like I got you good, man!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FSee, Adol? That was my real power!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That was a good fight.
I let my guard down.
#00100FYeah, it was.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...Wait, I'm the guy who won! Aren't I<<CRLF>>supposed to be the one saying that?<<CRLF>>
#00109FOh, come on, don't try and tell me you<<CRLF>>were just warming up or something!<<CRLF>>
#00101FYou lost, fair and square!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. Men really do get heated up when it<<CRLF>>comes to fighting, don't they?<<CRLF>>
You both did wonderfully.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yeah. I learned a lot just watching you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you for everything today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Sword Training'!
#00100FWell, I'm happy to hear it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FOh yeah! You called us here to train<<CRLF>>you, right?<<CRLF>>
#00100FWe're gonna run out of time at this rate.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
R-right!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm ready, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*huff* *huff*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you so much, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou've got potential, that's for sure.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh, really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I have to admit, I'm kind of surprised by how<<CRLF>>quickly you picked things up.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure you'll be a fine warrior, Lindsay.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well then, Adol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you again for all your help.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's not much, but please accept this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ah, you brought the fresh leaves I asked for?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yep, these are exactly what I wanted.<<CRLF>>Full of moisture.<<CRLF>>
*sniff* Aaah, this scent really does bring to<<CRLF>>mind the sun's warming rays, doesn't it?<<CRLF>>
Heheh, thank you. I'm sure the deer will be<<CRLF>>really happy too.<<CRLF>>
Here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'A Fresh Meal'!
#00200FThere it is!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FOops, looks like we weren't careful<<CRLF>>enough.<<CRLF>>
#00205FWe need to sneak around behind it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FAww, looks like it spotted us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FAww, it got away...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FHeh. Gotcha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00204FIt's looking right at us. We're not<<CRLF>>going to be able to approach it from here.<<CRLF>>
#00204F...I don't think we'll be able to catch<<CRLF>>it here.<<CRLF>>
#00204FAww, looks like it spotted us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

The forest seems to be stirring lately.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's not a good omen.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The Romuns say they've got no intention of<<CRLF>>taking over here...but there's no way I can<<CRLF>>trust them.
I've got to stay vigilant and keep guard.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
A messenger from some army is currently talking<<CRLF>>to the village chief.<<CRLF>>
I don't know what he's doing here, but I'm<<CRLF>>very concerned.<<CRLF>>
Right now, visitors from Selray and Casnan are<<CRLF>>in the village.<<CRLF>>
I suppose visitors aren't really anything<<CRLF>>unusual anymore, but I still can't help<<CRLF>>worrying about our future.
Calm down, now! I didn't say I wouldn't ever<<CRLF>>let you inside.<<CRLF>>
But right now, most of the men are out hunting.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So come back again later, okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who are you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And what's up with that pretentious hairstyle?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Remnos still hasn't returned, but the incident<<CRLF>>has at least been mostly resolved now.<<CRLF>>
You never know when something else like that<<CRLF>>might happen, however. I've got to stay vigilant.<<CRLF>>
What happened yesterday? It makes no sense!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

If the Romuns really start moving into the<<CRLF>>forest, we might not be able to stay here<<CRLF>>much longer.
I really hope it never comes to that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Arieda Fruits are mainly used as a cooking<<CRLF>>spice.<<CRLF>>
If you eat them raw, they're extremely hot,<<CRLF>>so be sure you're careful.<<CRLF>>
If you boil Raparo Fruits with honey, you can<<CRLF>>make a truly delicious jam.<<CRLF>>
And that jam can then be used to make exquisite<<CRLF>>pies.<<CRLF>>
Chito Nuts are known for their unusual texture --<<CRLF>>soft on the outside, but somewhat harder within.<<CRLF>>
One of their biggest selling points is that you<<CRLF>>can grind them down to make bread.<<CRLF>>
Eating fruit really makes one feel nourished.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Fruit truly is a blessing from the forest god.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We've been through a lot here lately, but I'm<<CRLF>>just glad everyone's all right.<<CRLF>>
Now my only worry is Remnos...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I still can't get over what happened yesterday.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How could such a thing come to pass?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

The warriors seem to be restless lately.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I hope nothing troublesome is happening...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We were born in the forest, and we live in the<<CRLF>>forest.<<CRLF>>
It's like a form of tribal pride. We can't have<<CRLF>>someone take that away from us.<<CRLF>>
I hope the army doesn't cause any trouble...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... I wonder how many years it's been since<<CRLF>>I last saw someone from Selray.<<CRLF>>
This really makes me appreciate just how<<CRLF>>important the things you take for granted<<CRLF>>in life truly are.
There's nothing more wonderful in the world<<CRLF>>than my granddaughter's smile.<<CRLF>>
I suppose this means things here can start<<CRLF>>going back to normal.<<CRLF>>
Though I'm still concerned about Remnos...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What's going on? Nothing happening lately<<CRLF>>seems to make any sense at all.<<CRLF>>
Someone said the Romuns might attack us.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But I can't let that happen! I have to fight!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Everyone's gone hunting today too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. I hope they bring back something good<<CRLF>>for dinner!<<CRLF>>
Some man covered in iron came here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Is he a foreigner too?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Some strange man came here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Is he a foreigner too?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ahaha! Today's weather is really nice.<<CRLF>>There's such a lovely breeze!<<CRLF>>
Most everyone who disappeared seems to have<<CRLF>>come back.<<CRLF>>
...But when's Remnos coming back?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The masked people who came here yesterday<<CRLF>>are naughty for causing so much trouble, right?<<CRLF>>
Naughty people need a good scolding!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, why did you get me earrings AGAIN?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Do you think I have six ears or something?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I hope Remio's not causing any trouble...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I hope Remio didn't do something stupid...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Remio... Do you love me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I hope Remio's not hurt...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm so happy you're back, Remio! I'm just...<<CRLF>>so, so happy...<<CRLF>>
Remio, oh Remio... Wherefore art thou, Remio?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Were you really one of the people who attacked<<CRLF>>the village yesterday, Remio?<<CRLF>>
If I'd known something like that was going to<<CRLF>>happen, I would've been more honest with you...<<CRLF>>
O-of course not!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I...I just thought you'd like them because<<CRLF>>they're pretty, th-that's all.<<CRLF>>
Of course I love you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm so sorry for worrying you, Saria.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Hand over Fresh Leaf x10
Cancel
Ah, you brought the fresh leaves I asked for?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Er, no, you didn't. You don't have enough<<CRLF>>of them.<<CRLF>>
Can you come back and let me know when you've<<CRLF>>got ten to spare?<<CRLF>>
I'll give the leaves you brought for me to the<<CRLF>>deer while they're still fresh.<<CRLF>>
Heheh. Thanks for getting them!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Everyone's talking about such unpleasant things<<CRLF>>lately.<<CRLF>>
Who cares about the Romuns? They don't scare<<CRLF>>me!<<CRLF>>
Aahhh... The breeze in the village is as<<CRLF>>refreshing as ever.<<CRLF>>
Today looks like it'll be a lovely day.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
People from that army came here again.<<CRLF>>They're still talking to the chief.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* There seems to be no end to the visitors<<CRLF>>we've been getting lately.<<CRLF>>
The chief is welcoming someone from Selray<<CRLF>>at the moment.<<CRLF>>
Though this man with him seems to have<<CRLF>>stomach pains. I wonder if he'll be okay...<<CRLF>>
The traveling companion of the man from Selray<<CRLF>>seems to have stomach pains. I wonder if he'll<<CRLF>>be okay...
On several levels, in fact...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The deer seem full of life today!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Their fur's glossy, their appetite is healthy...<<CRLF>>I've got nothing to worry about.<<CRLF>>
I really can't thank you enough.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You've made the deer really happy, too!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I can't believe those masked people managed to<<CRLF>>injure Asad. They must be ridiculously strong!<<CRLF>>
And people are saying that they're the villagers<<CRLF>>who were spirited away...which is even harder to<<CRLF>>believe.
Beasts can be husbands too...and vice versa.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
In fact, especially vice versa!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm worried about the army, but there's no point<<CRLF>>in worrying too much.<<CRLF>>
Maybe I should just forget all my worries and<<CRLF>>play with these guys instead. <<CRLF>>
Haha. They really are always like this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I think they're having fun, honestly. They just<<CRLF>>won't admit it.<<CRLF>>
They look like they're complete opposites,<<CRLF>>but their personalities are exactly alike.<<CRLF>>
Haha. It's fun just watching them!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. Watching these two really makes you feel<<CRLF>>at peace, you know?<<CRLF>>
I can never tell whether they get on really<<CRLF>>well or really poorly...<<CRLF>>
Haha. Children are so carefree.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm still feeling a little uneasy after<<CRLF>>everything that happened, but watching these<<CRLF>>two really helps ease the mind.
Shut up!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm a beast! A beast!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How many times do I have to tell you?<<CRLF>>You're supposed to run away!<<CRLF>>
What kind of beast runs right into an arrow?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wha...? Why are you surrendering?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Beasts don't just surrender! Put a little effort<<CRLF>>into this!<<CRLF>>
Stop grumbling!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Now I'm the hunter, so hurry up and run away,<<CRLF>>beast!<<CRLF>>
Yo, I'm home! Where's my dinner?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*munch* *munch* Oh. That was delicious.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Arrgh! Where's the fun in playing house?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm so boooooored...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're the one who needs to be quiet!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're supposed to be my husband!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh nooo, I've been shot!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm gonna dieeee!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh no, I surrender! I surrender!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* Where's the fun in playing hunters?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm so boooooored...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How many times do I have to tell you?!<<CRLF>>My husband would never be so rude!<<CRLF>>
The first thing you're supposed to say when you<<CRLF>>get home is, 'I love you, dear!'<<CRLF>>
Wh-what's with that half-hearted reaction?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're supposed to say it more lovingly!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Stop grumbling!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've made you your dinner, so hurry up and eat<<CRLF>>it!<<CRLF>>
It was really difficult, but I managed anyway.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. Tonight, we feast!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm not done yet!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh, really? It's all thanks to my training!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm not done yet!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you so much for your help today, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll keep striving to improve myself.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yes, I'm serious... I want to be stronger.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wow, you really managed to take one down?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Lindsay is out hunting right now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Naturally, everyone was against it at first...<<CRLF>>but now that everyone understands how serious<<CRLF>>she is, they've come to accept her decision.
Practicing swordsmanship helps you lose weight<<CRLF>>too?<<CRLF>>
...Maybe I should try it sometime after all...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're looking a lot fitter these days, Lindsay.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Whenever she's not helping out around the<<CRLF>>village, Lindsay's always practicing with her<<CRLF>>sword like that.
I thought she'd start complaining before long,<<CRLF>>but she's really dedicated!<<CRLF>>
That was a pretty intense battle to watch.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You both fought wonderfully.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Are you really planning on learning to use a<<CRLF>>sword?<<CRLF>>
I can't believe the missing villagers would<<CRLF>>even think of attacking us... Was Lindsay<<CRLF>>with them?
Any of us turning against Comodo is<<CRLF>>disturbing at best, but it's especially<<CRLF>>hard to imagine with her...
#10001FPretentious?! How dare you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FI'm Commander Leo of the Celcetan Army,<<CRLF>>and you are not to speak to me like that!<<CRLF>>
#10505FThe Commander's really angry now.<<CRLF>>Again.<<CRLF>>
#10505FIf he doesn't calm down, we're not going<<CRLF>>to get anywhere negotiating with them...<<CRLF>>
#10604FThere's a village right in front of our eyes,<<CRLF>>but we're not allowed to go inside. It's not<<CRLF>>fair!
#10604FI'm so huuuuuuungry...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So this is Comodo? Going to new places where<<CRLF>>you don't quite know how to behave is always<<CRLF>>a tricky proposition.
...My stomach hurts...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My stomach always starts hurting when I get<<CRLF>>nervous.<<CRLF>>
I get so angry with my stomach, it makes my<<CRLF>>stomach churn! Haha...<<CRLF>>
How could you not have heard of the legendary<<CRLF>>explorer, Rabbit Longears?<<CRLF>>
How ignorant are you?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Honestly, I think it's pretty normal not to<<CRLF>>have heard of you...<<CRLF>>
C'mon, let's do what he says and come back<<CRLF>>later, okay?<<CRLF>>
What are you two doing here?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FUh-oh. We've been spotted.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What are you doing?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FDamn! We've been seen!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How did you get out?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FCrap, they saw us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, aren't you two...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FOof. So much for sneaking out...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe need to gather more information<<CRLF>>on those masked guys.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's ask around the village.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHold on! We need to gather a little more<<CRLF>>information before we think about escaping.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWe should head back to the village and<<CRLF>>try to find something that'll trigger your<<CRLF>>memory.
Meeheehee! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Meeeeeheeeee!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#12105FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FStill, I am amazed that you came<<CRLF>>here from outside the forest.<<CRLF>>
#12006F#0899VI couldn't believe my ears when I heard<<CRLF>>that you repelled one of sis' knives with<<CRLF>>just your sword. She never misses.
#0896V#0MHey. I'm Remnos. It's nice to meet you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0897V#0MI'm sorry about the rude greeting you got<<CRLF>>from my sister earlier.<<CRLF>>
#0898V#0MAttacking anything that moves is what beasts do,<<CRLF>>not people.<<CRLF>>
#00209FI-I'm sorry, okay? I shouldn't have<<CRLF>>attacked without checking like that.<<CRLF>>
#12100FThe forest is the beasts' territory, where<<CRLF>>only the strongest can survive...<<CRLF>>
#12100FYou are unlikely to last there for long<<CRLF>>without honing your senses as Karna has.<<CRLF>>
#12100FI suppose there is little reason for <<CRLF>>concern, seeing as you traversed it<<CRLF>>with only that blade for defense.
#00203F#0254VYeah, he might not look like much, but<<CRLF>>his skill with a sword is really something.<<CRLF>>
#00200F#0255VYou'll have to fight me one-on-one<<CRLF>>sometime!<<CRLF>>
#12006FKarna, you're going to scare him off.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FWh-why? I bet he'd love to spar with<<CRLF>>me!<<CRLF>>
#12100FAdol, was it? These are my twins.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FKarna is one of the strongest hunters here,<<CRLF>>surpassing most of my men in ability. But<<CRLF>>then, you've discovered that first-hand...
#12105FRemnos, on the other hand, excels more<<CRLF>>in the arts. His strength lies in handicrafts<<CRLF>>and music.
#12100FI don't think you'll find two better guides<<CRLF>>to show you around the village.<<CRLF>>
Thank you for your kindness.
Can we start the tour right away?
#12105FIt's nothing, I assure you! Please, relax.<<CRLF>>This is our home, and we pride ourselves<<CRLF>>on our hospitality.
#12105FHmph. You show up here and immediately<<CRLF>>desire to know everything about the village.<<CRLF>>You truly are an unusual visitor, Adol.
#12100FI leave him in your care, my children.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FAs you wish, Father.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12003FLet's get started, then, shall we?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThus the tour of Comodo Village came to an end.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CIt flew by quickly, and was so fascinating that Adol forgot his<<CRLF>>exhaustion from exploring the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
#12006FI've heard this melody was composed in<<CRLF>>the image of a thriving kingdom that was<<CRLF>>supposedly located in the forest long ago.
It's a nice tune.
A kingdom?
#12003FHaha. It's been passed down for<<CRLF>>generations here in Comodo.<<CRLF>>
#12000FIt's like a lullaby that everyone in this<<CRLF>>village knows, young and old alike.<<CRLF>>
#12003FHaha. I knew that might perk your ears a<<CRLF>>bit.<<CRLF>>
#12006FThey say about eight hundred years ago,<<CRLF>>that very kingdom, remembered now<<CRLF>>only through song, flourished here.
#12006FThe ruins scattered all over the forest are<<CRLF>>apparently connected to it.<<CRLF>>
#12006FBut we know so little else. What kind of<<CRLF>>kingdom was it? How did it fall?<<CRLF>>
#12000FI've been trying to find the answers to<<CRLF>>these questions by inspecting the ruins<<CRLF>>and researching numerous old legends.
A worthy goal!
If you learn anything, let me know.
#12003FI'm happy to hear you say that, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FI only wish Father would understand this<<CRLF>>little passion of mine!<<CRLF>>
#12003FOh, I certainly will. You can count on it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FSo be sure you come back here someday,<<CRLF>>lest you miss out!<<CRLF>>
#00200F#0MHeeey!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FHow long are you two planning on sitting<<CRLF>>around out here? Dinner's almost ready!<<CRLF>>
#00200FFather says you're welcome to join us if <<CRLF>>you'd like, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#12003FFinally! I'm famished. Let's go get<<CRLF>>something to eat, my friend.<<CRLF>>
Phwee!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Phwee!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Just because you have the chief's permission<<CRLF>>to enter the village doesn't mean you can do<<CRLF>>whatever you'd like around here.
Don't go getting carried away, now!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Shreeeee...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Shreeeee...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's...really strange having a visitor here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How about trying one of the finest fruits the<<CRLF>>forest has to offer?<<CRLF>>
#12003FYay! <<|F481|>> I'd love one.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205FPut that hand down!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FNo one said you could have one.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. It's okay! I don't mind if Remnos has<<CRLF>>one too.<<CRLF>>
He's much cuter than the other men around<<CRLF>>here, after all! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
#12006FSee? It's fine!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204F*sigh* Why are all the girls around here<<CRLF>>so into him?<<CRLF>>
#00201FBut still! I'm your older sister, so if I say<<CRLF>>you can't have one, you can't have one!<<CRLF>>
#00202FWe're going now, Remnos!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12008FWhaaaat?! But Adol hasn't even had his<<CRLF>>yet!<<CRLF>>
Heheh. Karna is always really strict with<<CRLF>>Remnos.<<CRLF>>
But they get along great overall. I'm actually<<CRLF>>kind of jealous!<<CRLF>>
*sigh* Karna and Remnos really aren't much<<CRLF>>alike, are they?<<CRLF>>
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad<<CRLF>>thing...though I suppose there's no reason it<<CRLF>>would be a bad thing, now, is there?
So you're a foreigner?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How far away is reeeally far away? As far as<<CRLF>>that pikkard hut?<<CRLF>>
Ooh, it's Karna and Remnos! And...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Who are you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... So this is the foreigner.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What's a foreigner?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FWell, it means he came from reeeally far<<CRLF>>away.<<CRLF>>
#00200FHis name is Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ooh, really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Nice to meet you, Addie!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Nice to meet you, too.
Don't call me Addie.
Heheheh! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Aww, why not? It's cute!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12001FCome on, Adol. Let her call you Addie if<<CRLF>>she wants to.<<CRLF>>
#00204FYeah, don't be such a stick in the mud!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sounds like you had quite a difficult morning,<<CRLF>>Karna.<<CRLF>>
I just don't see why you should have to go out<<CRLF>>hunting. You're a young lady!<<CRLF>>
#00203FHeheh. Well, I do it because I enjoy it,<<CRLF>>so why not?<<CRLF>>
#00200FAnd I am the village chief's daughter,<<CRLF>>after all. Have to take after him somehow,<<CRLF>>you know?
#00200FThough I've still got quite a lot to learn<<CRLF>>before I'll ever be as good a hunter as he<<CRLF>>is.
Heehee. Karna's gonna be the chief some day!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206FHeh. Only if everyone in the village is<<CRLF>>okay with that, of course.<<CRLF>>
#12000FI can't imagine a single person would<<CRLF>>object.<<CRLF>>
#12003FIt's so wonderful to have an older sister<<CRLF>>like you, my dear Karna!<<CRLF>>
#00204F*sigh* Meanwhile, the village chief's son<<CRLF>>has no pride as a warrior at all.<<CRLF>>
Heehee. Well, Remnos is an artist!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12003FThat's right! See, she gets it! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* You're so insensitive...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
First you buy me earrings, then you buy me<<CRLF>>MORE earrings... Do you think I have four ears<<CRLF>>or something?!
Hmph. What's wrong with having a spare pair?<<CRLF>>You can never have too many earrings.<<CRLF>>
Don't be so picky about presents other people<<CRLF>>have bought for you!<<CRLF>>
Karna, Remnos and...a visitor from outside the<<CRLF>>village! Certainly not a group you see every day.<<CRLF>>
#00200FHeh. That's very true.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FEven just the two of us together is a bit<<CRLF>>of a rarity, given how different our daily<<CRLF>>activities are.
#12000FAs you can see we're showing young<<CRLF>>Adol here around the village.<<CRLF>>
Heheh. I figured as much.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, make sure you show him all the wonders<<CRLF>>of Comodo! Give him some good stories to tell<<CRLF>>his people.
...By the way, what do you think of deer? Do<<CRLF>>you like them?<<CRLF>>
Deer are such wonderful creatures, aren't they?<<CRLF>>They're my passion in life. My heart's desire.<<CRLF>>
They're cute, mysterious and majestic, all in<<CRLF>>one. The perfect animal!<<CRLF>>
Shreeeee...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* Oh no, they've started fighting again...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FHeh. I see these two are as much a<<CRLF>>handful as ever.<<CRLF>>
Yeah, they're always so stubborn...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Oh! Might you be...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FThat's right. He's the visitor from outside<<CRLF>>that everyone's been talking about.<<CRLF>>
I thought so. *cough* Well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Welcome to Comodo, traveler. Please make<<CRLF>>yourself at home here.<<CRLF>>
Why do they always have to be like this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Maybe I should behave more like an older brother<<CRLF>>and scold them into submission...<<CRLF>>
Shut up! Today we're playing hunters!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No, you shut up! Today we're playing house!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. Karna's really got the wrong idea,<<CRLF>>you know?<<CRLF>>
She should try chasing men instead of beasts!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FHey, Lindsay! I can hear you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. Karna's really got the wrong idea,<<CRLF>>you know?<<CRLF>>
She should try chasing men instead of beasts!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Welcome to Comodo.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Enjoy your stay!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So you're the fabled outsider...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Lindsay, that's not a very nice thing to call him.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But...what SHOULD we call him?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Either way, I'm surprised he didn't get eaten by<<CRLF>>beasts on his way through the forest, built like<<CRLF>>that...
#00203FHaha. Everyone thinks that when they<<CRLF>>first see him.<<CRLF>>
#12004F...Don't let it get you down, Adol. We<<CRLF>>don't get many visitors here, so niceties<<CRLF>>may be in short supply. *glare*
O-oh... I'm sorry!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Awww, don't get the wrong idea.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You may not look very muscular, but you do look<<CRLF>>quite handsome.<<CRLF>>
Yeah, I look up to strong, burly men, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'd love it if the men around here were a little<<CRLF>>more sensitive and...smooth...<<CRLF>>
Mmm, that sounds delicious!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Much like Remnos. In fact, he's the model<<CRLF>>which all smooth men should go by!<<CRLF>>
He knows how music and crafts can make a<<CRLF>>lady's heart go all aflutter...<<CRLF>>
#12003FHaha. I'm honored to hear such words<<CRLF>>from such lovely women as yourselves.<<CRLF>>
#00204FMmmnnng...<<CRLF>>Yeah, sorry, I just don't see it.<<CRLF>>
#00200FSo you're saying you want the two of<<CRLF>>them to be more like Father?<<CRLF>>
Well, that...wouldn't be too bad, actually...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ah, Karna. You never fail to make me smile.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FHmm? What do you mean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FOh, are you leaving the village already?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FYou've come all this way... Please, at<<CRLF>>least let us finish showing you around! It'll<<CRLF>>be worth your while, I'm certain of it.
#4CA carved wooden idol is displayed inside the shrine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FHeh. Do you like this statue?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FIt's a symbol of the forest god who<<CRLF>>watches over us.<<CRLF>>
#12000FIt's a custom around here to hold your<<CRLF>>hands together and pray to it.<<CRLF>>
#4CA carved wooden idol is displayed inside the shrine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp2202.JSON_TEXT 870 >>
#00200FSorry, but for the sake of everyone else<<CRLF>>in the village, I'm going to have to make<<CRLF>>you stay here for a while.
#00111FYou feel like telling us what's going on?<<CRLF>>Because I have no idea what I just<<CRLF>>wandered into.
#00200FI'll tell you everything later.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FFor now, just try and work it out for<<CRLF>>yourselves as best as you can, okay?<<CRLF>>
Okay!
How would we do that, exactly?
#00111F*sigh*<<CRLF>>I don't wanna hear that from you...<<CRLF>>
#00111FMight want to tone down the snarky<<CRLF>>attitude, man...<<CRLF>>
#00200F...I'll be back later.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FSorry, but I'm going to have to ask you<<CRLF>>to stay put for a while.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThere she goes... She seems like a pretty<<CRLF>>level-headed girl, at least.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSuppose you have to be to survive in a<<CRLF>>place like this.<<CRLF>>
#00101FStill, looks like we've wandered into<<CRLF>>something real bad this time.<<CRLF>>
#00101FYou sure you didn't do anything horrible<<CRLF>>to these people?<<CRLF>>
How can I be sure?
I really don't know...
#00100FAww, come on! Have some confidence in<<CRLF>>yourself!<<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, I suppose you wouldn't.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI don't want to start suspecting you either.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FBut this seems like just the sort of place<<CRLF>>you'd stick your nose into, if nothing else.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOh well. At least we're safe from the<<CRLF>>beasts and monsters here.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSuppose this is as good a chance as any<<CRLF>>to get some rest.<<CRLF>>
#4CThe next day...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*yawn*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FStarting to get pretty bored... How long're<<CRLF>>they gonna keep us waiting?<<CRLF>>
#00101F...Oh! Looks like somebody's here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Man's Voice
...Excuse me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FAllow me to introduce you. This is my<<CRLF>>father.<<CRLF>>
Muscular Warrior
#0M...I am Asad, the village chief.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI have met you once before, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MThough as Karna's told me you've lost your<<CRLF>>memories, I suppose you don't remember<<CRLF>>me?
I'm afraid I don't.
When did I come here last?
#12105FHmm... I see.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FI was hoping you would be able to tell<<CRLF>>me everything you know, but it seems<<CRLF>>that won't be possible.
#12105FYou came here about two weeks ago.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FThere was quite an uproar when you<<CRLF>>arrived, considering you were the first<<CRLF>>to come here from outside the forest.
#12100FBut the uproar now is much greater, and<<CRLF>>with a far less pleasant cause.<<CRLF>>
#00101FSo what IS going on here? Nobody seems<<CRLF>>to want to tell us.<<CRLF>>
#00201FRecently, several of the villagers have<<CRLF>>been spirited away.<<CRLF>>
#00109F'Spirited away'? What do you mean by<<CRLF>>that?<<CRLF>>
#00204FOne day, one of our own simply...<<CRLF>>disappeared. Without a trace.<<CRLF>>
#00204FThen another...and another...<<CRLF>>and none of them have come back since.<<CRLF>>
When did this start happening?
Could you know where they've gone?
#12105FThe first villager disappeared immediately<<CRLF>>after you left.<<CRLF>>
#12105FWe searched the surrounding area<<CRLF>>thoroughly, but could find no sign of him.<<CRLF>>
#12105FWe searched the surrounding area<<CRLF>>thoroughly, but have found no sign of<<CRLF>>them.
#12105FAnd the first villager that disappeared did<<CRLF>>so immediately after you left.<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhoa. Now that's some bad timing!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FSuppose that explains why everyone's<<CRLF>>holding him responsible, though...<<CRLF>>
#12105FTo my knowledge, you truly are the first<<CRLF>>person to come from outside the forest.<<CRLF>>
#12105FHow could I not think you the culprit,<<CRLF>>when something so out of the ordinary<<CRLF>>happened the moment you left?
#12100FA number of villagers are convinced that<<CRLF>>you angered the god of the forest.<<CRLF>>
#00111FWell, when you put it like that, I guess I<<CRLF>>can kinda see where you're coming from...<<CRLF>>
#00111FThe situation here really is just like it<<CRLF>>was in Selray.<<CRLF>>
#00204FThe people are taking turns patrolling our<<CRLF>>village now, day in and day out.<<CRLF>>
#00204FUnsurprisingly, many of them are getting<<CRLF>>rather...irritable...<<CRLF>>
What should I do?
I'll find the real culprit myself.
#12105FI'm not entirely sure I should trust you,<<CRLF>>to be perfectly honest.<<CRLF>>
#12100FAs the village chief, I would prefer to<<CRLF>>keep you in custody for a while longer.<<CRLF>>
#12105FI thought you might say that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FBut as the village chief, I would prefer to<<CRLF>>keep you here for a while longer.<<CRLF>>
#00101FHow much longer are we talking?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FThe search of the forest will be com-<<CRLF>>pleted by dawn.<<CRLF>>
#00101FAnd if you don't find anything, what<<CRLF>>happens then?<<CRLF>>
#12100FThat, I don't know. I will decide when<<CRLF>>the time comes.<<CRLF>>
#12100FI will return tomorrow. Karna, we're<<CRLF>>leaving.<<CRLF>>
#00209FO-oh, okay...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FAdol, I don't suppose you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100F...I don't suppose you remember Remnos,<<CRLF>>do you?<<CRLF>>
#00209F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Remnos?
The name sounds familiar...
#12105FI expected as much...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FShould you happen to remember anything,<<CRLF>>please let me know.<<CRLF>>
#00111FSo if they don't find anything, it looks<<CRLF>>like everyone's just gonna assume it<<CRLF>>was you after all.
#00111FOnly way for the village to move past<<CRLF>>this is to make someone take the fall<<CRLF>>for it. Which is ridiculous.
#00100FLevel with me here. You have any idea<<CRLF>>who that Remnos guy he mentioned<<CRLF>>might be?
#00004F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I might have an idea.
I don't know.
#00109F...The man you saw in your dream back<<CRLF>>at the camp?<<CRLF>>
#00101FYou think he could've come from this<<CRLF>>village?<<CRLF>>
#00101FMaybe you could paint a clearer picture if<<CRLF>>we could just find something else to trigger<<CRLF>>your memory...
#00111FOh, come on! You totally remembered<<CRLF>>something there. It was written all over<<CRLF>>your face!
#00111FDon't tease me, now...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FMaybe you could paint a clearer picture if<<CRLF>>we could just find something else to trigger<<CRLF>>your memory...
Let's gather information.
Let's run away.
#00111FYeah, sitting around here isn't getting us<<CRLF>>anywhere.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOne sec...there we go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, well. That's a surprise! Much more<<CRLF>>reasonable course of action than I'd've ever<<CRLF>>expected from a do-gooder like you.
#00100FAll right, hold up...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FThat should do it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI hate taking big risks, but an information<<CRLF>>dealer like me tends to pick up a few tricks<<CRLF>>every now and again for times like this.
#12100F...A...masked...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FWe do have a custom of hanging masks<<CRLF>>in our homes to repel evil, but I can't<<CRLF>>imagine...
#00104FYeah, if it were that type of mask, it<<CRLF>>would've stuck out like a sore thumb<<CRLF>>around here.
#00104FSo most likely, that wasn't it. Not based<<CRLF>>on what Adol's been telling us.<<CRLF>>
#00100FGuess the easiest thing to do is to ask<<CRLF>>Remnos directly. Is he here?<<CRLF>>
#12105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...Something wrong?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FRemnos...is not available to speak with<<CRLF>>you.<<CRLF>>
#00109FHe isn't? Did he go out somewhere?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FNot exactly, no. He's one of the disappear-<<CRLF>>ances. We have no idea where he is right<<CRLF>>now.
#00204FThere's been no word from him since the<<CRLF>>day he saw Adol off.<<CRLF>>
#00109FSo he was spirited away too, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100F...I appreciate you telling me all of this,<<CRLF>>Adol.<<CRLF>>
#12100FBut I'm afraid I don't know how much of<<CRLF>>your story I can believe...<<CRLF>>
#00201FFather, outside!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FAdol. Duren. Stay here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12102F#16SKarna, let's go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SRight!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat's going on out there?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Let's go find out.
Let's just wait here.
#00100FWell, standing here sure isn't going to<<CRLF>>help...<<CRLF>>
#00100FAll right, let's go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100F...Who ARE you, and what've you done<<CRLF>>to Adol Christin?!<<CRLF>>
#00100FI'm going to have to be the reckless one<<CRLF>>this time, I guess. No point in standing<<CRLF>>around, you know?
#00100FLet's go see what's happening.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...So that means the villagers who were<<CRLF>>spirited away are the ones wearing the<<CRLF>>masks?
#00204FProbably...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FProbably? You're not sure?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FFather is without a doubt the strongest<<CRLF>>warrior in the village.<<CRLF>>
#00204FBut that masked man was able to take<<CRLF>>him down easily.<<CRLF>>
#00204FThat shouldn't even be possible...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...So absolutely none of the villagers<<CRLF>>who disappeared are strong enough<<CRLF>>to hurt him?
#00101FAnd even if they were, what the hell<<CRLF>>would they be after?!<<CRLF>>
#00204FI don't know the answer to that either...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FWhy would they attack their own home?<<CRLF>>It makes no sense...<<CRLF>>
#12105F#2WUgh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FFather!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThere we go. Up and at 'em, Chief!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12109F#2WWhere...am I...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FDon't worry. You're home.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100F#2WI see...<<CRLF>>...Thank...you...<<CRLF>>
#12105F#2W...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FFather, I, um...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100F#2WKarna...<<CRLF>>Don't go...after that masked man...<<CRLF>>
#00209FHuh? Wh-why not?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100F#2WUntil my...wounds have healed...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100F#2WTell...everyone...don't...<<CRLF>>That man...is...<<CRLF>>
#12105F#2W...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209F...Father?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FLooks like he's out cold again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHe's gonna need to rest for a while<<CRLF>>longer to get his strength back.<<CRLF>>
#00204F...What was he trying to say?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FDunno. But it seems like he noticed<<CRLF>>something during the fight, that's for<<CRLF>>sure.
#00100FGuess all we can do is wait for him to<<CRLF>>wake up again and ask.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo, Adol, what're we gonna do now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Let's gather information.
Let's go looking for them.
#00111FMan, I knew you'd try to stay involved.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's ask around and see if we<<CRLF>>can learn anything new about what<<CRLF>>happened yesterday, then.
#00109FThem? You mean the masked villagers?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FLook for them where? We don't have any<<CRLF>>idea where they could have gone!<<CRLF>>
#00204F...The search party might know something.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI'll just keep an eye on Father for a while<<CRLF>>longer, then I'll be right behind you.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLooks like that's settled, then.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAll right, let's get started!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...So that man was Remnos, then?<<CRLF>>You're sure?<<CRLF>>
#12105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FHe... Ever since he was a child, the<<CRLF>>slightest effort was all it took for him<<CRLF>>to achieve whatever goal he sought.
#12100FHe learned the skills I taught him almost<<CRLF>>instantaneously. Even the art of war, and<<CRLF>>hunting techniques...
#12100FHowever, he began to hide those skills<<CRLF>>from Karna, concerned by how she would<<CRLF>>feel if she knew.
#12100FAnd eventually, he had completely<<CRLF>>dedicated himself to music and crafts.<<CRLF>>
#12105F...Because in those fields, he wouldn't<<CRLF>>have to hold back for anyone...<<CRLF>>
#00109FI...kind of get where he's coming from.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FI have failed as a father. I'm sure Karna<<CRLF>>was shocked when she found out.<<CRLF>>
#12105FI'm sorry, but I would ask that you leave<<CRLF>>her be for a while.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Where did she go?
#12100FI agree with you, of course...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FBut it will likely take some time before<<CRLF>>she fully recovers from the shock.<<CRLF>>
#12100FI believe she left the village earlier with<<CRLF>>some of the other warriors.<<CRLF>>
#12100FI'm sure she wants some time to sort<<CRLF>>things out for herself.<<CRLF>>
#00111F...Hey, come to think of it, do we have<<CRLF>>any more leads as to the identity of that<<CRLF>>magician woman?
#12100FI'm afraid we don't.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FShe is not from this area. Of that I am<<CRLF>>certain.<<CRLF>>
#12100FBut I know nothing more.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FShe said the masks were part of some<<CRLF>>sort of experiment.<<CRLF>>
#00101FAnd she didn't seem to be anyone the<<CRLF>>Governor General could have sent...<<CRLF>>
#12100FThe villagers who had disappeared have<<CRLF>>now gone back to their normal lives.<<CRLF>>
#12100FComodo, it seems, is beginning to return<<CRLF>>to normal. Still, this feels like the start of<<CRLF>>something much bigger...
#12105FPerhaps we need to decide, as a village,<<CRLF>>what we will do from here on out.<<CRLF>>
#12100FAdol, where do you intend to go from<<CRLF>>here?<<CRLF>>
#00101FActually, about that... Do you know where<<CRLF>>Adol headed after he left here before?<<CRLF>>
#12105FNot for certain, but I recall him mention-<<CRLF>>ing a village on the bank of the river. I<<CRLF>>suspect he may have gone there.
#00101FA village on the bank of the river, huh?<<CRLF>>Sounds like Selray.<<CRLF>>
#00101FOn the bank of the river? Sounds like the<<CRLF>>other point I marked on the map.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAll right, Adol, it's up to you. Where to<<CRLF>>next?<<CRLF>>
Head toward the river
Return to Casnan
#12100FVery well. I wish you a safe journey.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FIf you happen to hear anything more about<<CRLF>>Remnos, please do let me know.<<CRLF>>
#12105FI'm forever indebted to you for all you've<<CRLF>>done here.<<CRLF>>
#12101FI wish you well in recovering your<<CRLF>>memories.<<CRLF>>
#12101FPlease know that you will always be<<CRLF>>welcome in Comodo.<<CRLF>>
#4CYou can now accept quests in Comodo.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, nice to see you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Guess you saw my request on the board?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FSure did! There's something you want<<CRLF>>us to do for you?<<CRLF>>
Yeah. You got a few minutes to listen?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm sure you already know, but my job involves<<CRLF>>making all different kinds of crafts.<<CRLF>>
Recently, though, I've been thinking about<<CRLF>>expanding my line-up.<<CRLF>>
So I'd appreciate it if you could bring me<<CRLF>>this new material I've been trying to find...<<CRLF>>
#00209FSorry, I haven't checked the board for a<<CRLF>>while.<<CRLF>>
#00200FIs there something you'd like us to do?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yeah... Well, seeing as you're here, I'll just<<CRLF>>explain it to you now.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure you already know, but my job involves<<CRLF>>making all different kinds of crafts.<<CRLF>>
Recently, though, I've been thinking about<<CRLF>>expanding my line-up.<<CRLF>>
So I'd appreciate it if you could bring me<<CRLF>>this new material I've been trying to find...<<CRLF>>
#00200FWhat material would that be?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's called an 'Indestructible Shell.' You can<<CRLF>>harvest it from monsters near the river, but we<<CRLF>>don't usually go that far into the forest.
#00205FAn 'Indestructible Shell'? The name alone<<CRLF>>suggests this won't be an easy harvest.<<CRLF>>
Yeah, it's a remarkably sturdy thing.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Which makes working with it all the more<<CRLF>>difficult. But if I can get my hands on some,<<CRLF>>I can try making all kinds of new crafts.
#00203FSounds like a worthy goal!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FSo how many of them do you need?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... Three should be plenty.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FThree Indestructible Shells? All right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FCome on, Adol! Let's go get them!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks for the help.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CThe quest 'Crafting Materials' has been\nadded to your journal.
#00200FWe brought what you asked for, Saisen.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm, so you did. Thanks muchly!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All right, let me try making you something with<<CRLF>>these.<<CRLF>>
Can you wait just a moment?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There we are. That should do it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FWow, this is nice!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FAnd it feels more powerful than the<<CRLF>>accessories you usually craft.<<CRLF>>
#00200FIs it really okay for us to take this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Of course! It's the reward I planned to give<<CRLF>>you from the start.<<CRLF>>
Besides, those shells will last me a good long<<CRLF>>while. Thanks to you, I can create all sorts<<CRLF>>of new accessories from now on!
So if there's anything else you want me to<<CRLF>>make, just let me know.<<CRLF>>
#00203FHaha, thanks! I can't wait to see what<<CRLF>>else you come up with.<<CRLF>>
#00200FWe'll be back if we need anything new.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#4CYou can now craft additional accessories at\nSaisen's workshop!
Actually, sorry to throw this on you so soon<<CRLF>>after you've only just finished helping me,<<CRLF>>but...
There's actually another material I'd like you<<CRLF>>to bring as well.<<CRLF>>
There's no rush, though! So just let me know<<CRLF>>when you're able to help.<<CRLF>>
#00200FAll right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CA new quest was added to Comodo's quest board.
#3CThe quest 'Crafting Materials 2' has been\nadded to your journal.
Hey, nice to see you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There's actually another material I'd like you<<CRLF>>to bring me.<<CRLF>>
#00200FAnd what would that be?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, I read about it in an old book I'd brought<<CRLF>>in from the forest...<<CRLF>>
Supposedly it's a really tough kind of hide you<<CRLF>>can harvest from beasts in the Primeval Lands.<<CRLF>>
People used to refer to it simply as a<<CRLF>>'Bizarre Hide.'<<CRLF>>
You've made it across the river, so I thought<<CRLF>>it might be possible you'd find some in your<<CRLF>>travels.
#00200FSo you want us to bring you one of<<CRLF>>those 'Bizarre Hides'?<<CRLF>>
Yeah. If I had one of those, I'd be able to make<<CRLF>>all kinds of new crafts.<<CRLF>>
Just the one should be enough this time.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you find anything like it on your travels,<<CRLF>>please let me know.<<CRLF>>
#00200FOkay. We'll see what we can do.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CA new quest was added to Comodo's quest board.
#3CThe quest 'Crafting Materials 2' has been\nadded to your journal.
#00200FIs this what you were looking for,<<CRLF>>Saisen?<<CRLF>>
So strong and yet so flexible... Yes, this is<<CRLF>>exactly what I was looking for!<<CRLF>>
All right, let me try making something with<<CRLF>>this.<<CRLF>>
Can you wait just a moment?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... Not bad, if I do say so myself.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here you go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FOoh, this does look really polished.<<CRLF>>Thanks!<<CRLF>>
#00200FSee you later, Saisen.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Come by anytime. And if you need me to craft<<CRLF>>anything, just bring me the materials.<<CRLF>>
Work me as hard as you'd like!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Hey, nice to see you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There's actually another material I'd like you<<CRLF>>to bring me.<<CRLF>>
#00200FAll right. What is it this time?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I read about this one in an ancient text as<<CRLF>>well.<<CRLF>>
It seems that long, long ago, there was a<<CRLF>>beast in the Primeval Lands that had incredibly<<CRLF>>sturdy bones.
They're referred to in these old texts as<<CRLF>>'Titanic Bones.'<<CRLF>>
#00200FSo you want us to bring you a Titanic<<CRLF>>Bone, then?<<CRLF>>
Exactly. This must all be second nature to you<<CRLF>>by now.<<CRLF>>
If I had one of those, I'd be able to craft all<<CRLF>>kinds of new accessories.<<CRLF>>
And again, I only need one.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you find anything like it on your travels,<<CRLF>>please let me know.<<CRLF>>
#00200FOkay, got it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CA new quest was added to Comodo's quest board.
#3CThe quest 'Crafting Materials 3' has been\nadded to your journal.
#00200FHere you go, Saisen! We brought the<<CRLF>>Titanic Bone you were looking for, I<<CRLF>>believe.
Mmm, very sturdy indeed. No doubt about it,<<CRLF>>this is the material I was after. I should be<<CRLF>>able to make some incredible things with this.
Please, let me craft something right away.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This might be my crowning achievement to date!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here you go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FWow... I've never seen anything this<<CRLF>>well-crafted before.<<CRLF>>
#00200FThanks so much, Saisen!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yes, yes. If you should ever need me to craft<<CRLF>>anything for you, just bring me the materials.<<CRLF>>
Work me as hard as you'd like!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Crafting Materials 3'!
#4CYou can now craft additional accessories at\nSaisen's workshop!
#00200FHi, Pippi. I see one of your chicke--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205FEr, I mean, one of your precious children<<CRLF>>has gone missing.<<CRLF>>
Yes, isn't it awful?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
They're always causing me so much trouble!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Would you be willing to bring him home for me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, have you decided to help catch my missing<<CRLF>>child after all?<<CRLF>>
Accept
Refuse
Really? That's a terrible shame.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'd ask one of the men for help, but they're all<<CRLF>>so busy...<<CRLF>>
Thank you so much. I really appreciate your<<CRLF>>assistance.<<CRLF>>
#00200FSo, which of your little ones has run<<CRLF>>away this time?<<CRLF>>
His name is Sasami. I know that's more of a<<CRLF>>hen's name, but I like to think I'm progressive.<<CRLF>>You can recognize him by his white feathers.
And like the rest of my lovely little children,<<CRLF>>he's extremely cautious.<<CRLF>>
So when you're trying to catch him, do make<<CRLF>>sure you approach from behind.<<CRLF>>
If you try to approach him from the front, he'll<<CRLF>>be sure to run away.<<CRLF>>
#00205FSo we've got to make sure he doesn't<<CRLF>>see us coming. Check.<<CRLF>>
#00200FDo you have any idea where he might be<<CRLF>>hiding?<<CRLF>>
I'm sure he's still in the village, at least.<<CRLF>>He's a bit of a scaredy-puss, so he wouldn't<<CRLF>>have left.
I think he'll be outside, too, as he wouldn't<<CRLF>>want to approach anyone's home.<<CRLF>>
#00200FSo we're looking outdoors, but within the<<CRLF>>village?<<CRLF>>
#00203FOkay, got it! That should be plenty to<<CRLF>>work with.<<CRLF>>
#00200FCome on, Adol, let's go get him!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you so much for bringing my lovely<<CRLF>>Sasami back home, safe and sound.<<CRLF>>
Here's the reward I promised.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FThanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FNow, play nice with them, okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*chuckle* Of course! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'The Runaway Chick'!
#3CCompleted the quest 'The Runaway Chick'!
#00200FWhat's wrong, Pippi?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I... I only took my eyes off my little darlings<<CRLF>>for a single moment...<<CRLF>>
But another one of them appears to have escaped!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My attention was elsewhere, and...now he's gone!<<CRLF>>He really is a troublemaker...<<CRLF>>
I suppose I'll have to put another request on<<CRLF>>the board.<<CRLF>>
I do apologize for asking, but if you'd be able<<CRLF>>to find the time to bring him home, it would<<CRLF>>be most appreciated.
#00203FS-sure, okay.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CA new quest was added to Comodo's quest board.
#3CThe quest 'The Naughty Chick' has been\nadded to your journal.
#00200FErm, Pippi...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm terribly sorry for troubling you with this<<CRLF>>again.<<CRLF>>
But would you be willing to go bring back<<CRLF>>another of my dear little ones?<<CRLF>>
Oh, have you decided to help catch my runaway<<CRLF>>child after all?<<CRLF>>
Accept
Refuse
Really? That's a terrible shame.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'd ask one of the men for help, but they're all<<CRLF>>so busy...<<CRLF>>
Thank you so much. I really appreciate your<<CRLF>>help.<<CRLF>>
#00200FSo, what are we looking for this time?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This time it's little Teva who's run away. He's<<CRLF>>still just a chick.<<CRLF>>
So he's full of energy and just loves playing<<CRLF>>around.<<CRLF>>
And he particularly enjoys hiding in the<<CRLF>>shade.<<CRLF>>
#00204FA chick hiding in the shade? Sounds like<<CRLF>>a tall order this time.<<CRLF>>
I'm afraid so. And he's just as cautious as<<CRLF>>Sasami, too!<<CRLF>>
So you'll need to approach him from behind,<<CRLF>>just like before.<<CRLF>>
Oh, and I don't think it's likely he'll have<<CRLF>>wandered into anyone's home either, so he<<CRLF>>should be somewhere outdoors.
#00206FIn the village, outside, same as last time.<<CRLF>>Check.<<CRLF>>
#00200FJust leave everything to us. We'll have him<<CRLF>>back here before you know it!<<CRLF>>
Thank you so much for bringing my lovely Teva<<CRLF>>back home, safe and sound.<<CRLF>>
Here's the reward I promised.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FThanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FNow, play nice with them, okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*chuckle* Of course! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#3CCompleted the quest 'The Naughty Chick'!
#00200FWhat's wrong, Pippi?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, I'm so sorry to keep bothering you, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...I think you can guess what happened.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FAGAIN?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I only took my eyes off him for a moment,<<CRLF>>I swear! *sigh* He's as much of a wanderer<<CRLF>>as ever...
I suppose I'll have to put another request on<<CRLF>>the board.<<CRLF>>
I'm so very sorry to keep troubling you, but if<<CRLF>>you get the chance, I'd really appreciate your<<CRLF>>help.
#00203FO-okay, we'll try.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CA new quest was added to Comodo's quest board.
#3CThe quest 'The Wandering Chick' has been\nadded to your journal.
#00200FUm, Pippi...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm terribly sorry for troubling you with this<<CRLF>>yet again.<<CRLF>>
But would you be willing to go and bring another<<CRLF>>of my little chickadees back here?<<CRLF>>
Oh, have you decided to help catch my little<<CRLF>>escapee after all?<<CRLF>>
Accept
Refuse
Really? That's a terrible shame.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'd ask one of the men for help, but they're all<<CRLF>>so busy...<<CRLF>>
Thank you so much. I really appreciate your<<CRLF>>help.<<CRLF>>
#00200FSo, which one is it now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
His name is Tsukune. He's recognizable by his<<CRLF>>brown feathers, and is probably the most<<CRLF>>energetic of all my little babies.
He's cautious and needs to be approached from<<CRLF>>behind like usual, but...<<CRLF>>
He also tends to wander a little bit farther<<CRLF>>than the others.<<CRLF>>
#00209FDoes that mean he might've wandered<<CRLF>>outside the village?<<CRLF>>
I'm afraid that's quite likely.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But even if he has, it won't be far.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I think it's likely he's somewhere on the plains<<CRLF>>just outside the village entrance.<<CRLF>>
#00203FOh, okay. Whew! We might actually have<<CRLF>>a chance of finding him then.<<CRLF>>
#00200FCome on! Let's get searching!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you so much for bringing my lovely<<CRLF>>Tsukune back safely.<<CRLF>>
Here's the reward I promised.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FThanks.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FPlay nice with them, and KEEP AN EYE<<CRLF>>ON THEM. I don't want another missing<<CRLF>>chick-- er, child quest on the board!
*chuckle* My eyes shall never wander again.<<CRLF>>They'll be my little prisoners! Hee hee hee... <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'The Wandering Chick'!
#00205FI'll just keep an eye on Father for a while<<CRLF>>longer, then I'll be right behind you.<<CRLF>>
#00200FUntil then, feel free to ask around all<<CRLF>>you'd like.<<CRLF>>
#12100FAh, Karna. It looks like...you have some-<<CRLF>>thing to say to me, if I'm not mistaken.<<CRLF>>
#00205FYeah. I...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI finally managed to snap Remnos back<<CRLF>>to his senses.<<CRLF>>
#12109F#15SDid you?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206F...I did. It wasn't easy, but we managed<<CRLF>>to free him from the enemy's control.<<CRLF>>
#00200FHe's resting somewhere safe now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FI'm so happy to hear that...<<CRLF>>Thank you for letting me know.<<CRLF>>
#00200FNo problem. I...I know you have a lot to<<CRLF>>ask me, and I have a lot to tell you, but...<<CRLF>>
#12101F...I understand.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12101FYou intend to stay with Adol until he has<<CRLF>>finished what he set out to do, correct?<<CRLF>>
#00206FHeh. You always could see right through<<CRLF>>me.<<CRLF>>
#00200FMaybe I take after you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12101FNo maybe about it...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FIf that's your decision, any matters we<<CRLF>>have to discuss can wait.<<CRLF>>
#12101FPlease take good care of Karna, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12101FAnd be sure to come back here when<<CRLF>>you've finished your journey.<<CRLF>>
#12101FI'll hold a feast in your honor.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I promise I will.
I'll never say no to food.
#12105FI'll hold you to your word...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12101FAnd I won't forgive you if you break it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12101FHaha. As well you shouldn't. I'll make<<CRLF>>certain it's the best you've ever had.<<CRLF>>
#12101FWe'll give you the warmest welcome<<CRLF>>we can as a village.<<CRLF>>
#00200F...We're going to go now, Father.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12101FGive it your best out there, Karna.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FSo Remnos is safe after all...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FI had feared the worst, so I'm truly<<CRLF>>relieved to hear that he's all right.<<CRLF>>
#12101FTake care. Don't let your guard down<<CRLF>>until the very end. You never know what<<CRLF>>dangers might be lying in wait for you.
#12101FCome back here when you've finished<<CRLF>>what you set out to do. We can talk then.<<CRLF>>
#12101FTake care. Don't let your guard down<<CRLF>>until the very end. You never know what<<CRLF>>dangers might be lying in wait for you.
#12101FCome back here when you've finished<<CRLF>>what you set out to do. We can talk then.<<CRLF>>
#12100FAh... I'm sorry, but as you can see, I'm<<CRLF>>rather busy at the moment.<<CRLF>>
#12100FIf you have some business with me, could<<CRLF>>you come back again another time?<<CRLF>>
#12105FRomn, the Governor General, the Masked<<CRLF>>Division... All Romuns, and yet all with<<CRLF>>different objectives...
#12105FIt seems to be true that the larger an<<CRLF>>organization gets, the harder it is to<<CRLF>>keep it unified.
#12105FSo a terrible incident occurred in Selray,<<CRLF>>as well?<<CRLF>>
#12100FI've no idea if it's like what happened<<CRLF>>here, but it is suggesting a pattern, and<<CRLF>>I don't like where this pattern is leading.
#12100FI see you managed to reunite with Adol,<<CRLF>>Karna.<<CRLF>>
#00206FYep!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI'll drag Remnos back here no matter<<CRLF>>what. You just wait!<<CRLF>>
#12105FThank you. I will leave him in your care,<<CRLF>>then.<<CRLF>>
#12100FAnd when you've brought him home<<CRLF>>safely...<<CRLF>>
#12100FThen you can tell him everything that's<<CRLF>>on your mind.<<CRLF>>
#00200FYou know I will.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206FThank you, Father.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FPlease take good care of Karna, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FWe haven't known each other for long,<<CRLF>>but your actions tell me that you are a<<CRLF>>man of strength, and worthy of my trust.
#12100FAnd between you and I...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FI would have no objections were you to<<CRLF>>take Karna as your bride.<<CRLF>>
#00209FF-Father?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I-I'm honored...
Who says I haven't already?
#00205FI guess Adol does seem like someone<<CRLF>>who'd change things for the better around<<CRLF>>here.
#00200FHe's not quite as reliable as you, Father,<<CRLF>>but he's equally strong-willed.<<CRLF>>
#00203FAnd with Adol in the village, I'd always<<CRLF>>have someone I could spar with!<<CRLF>>
#00205FOh, you be quiet! Don't be taken in by<<CRLF>>his bad sense of humor, Father. We still<<CRLF>>have a lot to learn about one another.
#00200FI'm sure you'd make a good village chief,<<CRLF>>though, Adol!<<CRLF>>
#00203FAnd with you around, I'd always have<<CRLF>>someone to spar with.<<CRLF>>
#12105FHaha. As expected of my daughter.<<CRLF>>Always looking for the strategic advantage.<<CRLF>>
#00200FHmm?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FAt any rate...you've come a long way to<<CRLF>>be here, so please, take this with you.<<CRLF>>
#12101FDo be careful on your journey. I'll be<<CRLF>>thinking of you.<<CRLF>>
#00203FHeh. Thank you, Father.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FI leave Karna in your care.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FBest of luck on your journey, all of you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105FI worry about what that magician woman<<CRLF>>is after. Whatever it is, it can't be good.<<CRLF>>
#12100FIt seems I have a lot to think about now...<<CRLF>>Remnos included.<<CRLF>>
#12105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAsad is sleeping, with a peaceful expression on his face.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205F...Have a good rest, Father.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FI'll take care of everything here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAsad is sleeping, with a peaceful expression on his face.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This isn't my first time in Comodo, but...it's<<CRLF>>been so long, I can hardly remember when I was<<CRLF>>here last.
Regardless, this is a great opportunity to<<CRLF>>discuss important matters.<<CRLF>>
#00309FCirrus? What brings you here?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There has been much trouble of late.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So I thought I would consult Asad here, as a<<CRLF>>fellow resident of the Great Forest, and discuss<<CRLF>>possible safety measures we could take.
#12105FThe people of Comodo and Selray have<<CRLF>>had very little contact up till now.<<CRLF>>
#12105FThis may be a good opportunity for us<<CRLF>>to aid one another in various ways.<<CRLF>>
#12101FWe are currently discussing that issue in<<CRLF>>more detail.<<CRLF>>
#00301FI see. The people here are trustworthy, so<<CRLF>>building ties with them may be beneficial<<CRLF>>for us all.
#00305FI cannot say why it has never occurred to<<CRLF>>me to do this before.<<CRLF>>
#00205FI hadn't really thought much about the<<CRLF>>world outside the village myself, until<<CRLF>>this whole mess started.
#00200FMaybe we all need to start looking at<<CRLF>>things from a broader perspective.<<CRLF>>
#12101FI concur, and that is exactly what Cirrus<<CRLF>>and I are speaking of now.<<CRLF>>
#12105FI should probably include all of you in the<<CRLF>>discussions as well, at some point.<<CRLF>>
But I know you have more pressing matters to<<CRLF>>attend to at the moment.<<CRLF>>
So for the time being, please leave this to us.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FAll right. Thank you, Father.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FThere are none more suited to this task<<CRLF>>than you, Cirrus. You have my full support.<<CRLF>>

Ran out of something important?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

So bringing him home isn't going to be easy...<<CRLF>>But please, do your best!<<CRLF>>
Oh, Tsukune, please come home soon...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder what I should have for dinner<<CRLF>>tonight...<<CRLF>>

The key to capturing him is to approach from<<CRLF>>behind.<<CRLF>>

Oh, Sasami, please come home soon...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
A mask that draws out people's latent<<CRLF>>strength? I would never have thought<<CRLF>>such a thing to be possible.
What could that magician woman be planning?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So the missing villagers actually attacked us?<<CRLF>>And they were wearing masks?<<CRLF>>

Something major seems to be happening deeper<<CRLF>>in the forest.<<CRLF>>
Considering the army's involvement, it doesn't<<CRLF>>seem likely that we'll be able to avoid being<<CRLF>>drawn into whatever's going on.
I'll have to discuss the best course of action<<CRLF>>with Asad.<<CRLF>>

We thought life here was going to return to<<CRLF>>normal after the missing villagers returned.<<CRLF>>
But it looks like life is never quite that<<CRLF>>simple. Even when the only thing we ask for<<CRLF>>is peace...
Thoth was talking to his father for hours<<CRLF>>yesterday, yet he already misses him.<<CRLF>>
Heh. I'm kind of jealous!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thoth is always wondering what his father does.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He looks up to him so much! Is this what all<<CRLF>>boys are like?<<CRLF>>
The men aren't going out hunting today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here in Comodo, we believe in hunting only for<<CRLF>>what we need, when we need it.<<CRLF>>
Looking after the house and caring for my son,<<CRLF>>while waiting for my husband to return from his<<CRLF>>hunting excursions...
I take it for granted sometimes, but honestly,<<CRLF>>I'm incredibly grateful to have such a happy<<CRLF>>life.
...Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a lot of<<CRLF>>sewing to take care of.<<CRLF>>

I can't even begin to tell you how grateful<<CRLF>>I am to you. I'm just so happy to have him back!<<CRLF>>
People think my husband might have been one<<CRLF>>of the men who attacked the village.<<CRLF>>
How could something like this happen?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mommy and Daddy look so serious lately.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't like it when they look like that.<<CRLF>>I wish they'd go back to smiling...<<CRLF>>
When's Daddy going to come home?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wanna hear about his hunting trip!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if Daddy's fighting big, scary monsters<<CRLF>>right now...<<CRLF>>
I wanna grow up and go hunting too! Can't I<<CRLF>>grow up faster?!<<CRLF>>
Daddy promised he'd train me today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#3CCompleted the quest 'The Tyrannical Frogs'!
Golwonga appears to be a subspecies of the<<CRLF>>Bozonga.<<CRLF>>
I've heard it's no less threatening than a<<CRLF>>Bozonga, either. If you decide to fight it,<<CRLF>>please be very careful!
Ribbi-Magi are intelligent, ferocious<<CRLF>>beasts.<<CRLF>>
They're known to show up in areas full of<<CRLF>>natural resources and cause all kinds of<<CRLF>>trouble.
Defeating them might be difficult, so just<<CRLF>>driving them away should be enough.<<CRLF>>
Everyone's nervous about what the future holds,<<CRLF>>but that's all the more reason we need to come<<CRLF>>together.
Living in the forest has always had its dangers,<<CRLF>>but we've gotten through them as a village.<<CRLF>>

He's had a lot on his mind lately.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So I hope he can at least put his worries aside<<CRLF>>for a while as he concentrates on his prey.<<CRLF>>

So I hope he can at least put his worries aside<<CRLF>>for a while as he concentrates on his prey.<<CRLF>>
There's been very little change in our lives<<CRLF>>until recently.<<CRLF>>
If more and more people keep arriving here from<<CRLF>>outside the village, how will we be affected by it?<<CRLF>>What will it...do to us?
I must admit, it does worry me...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

I must admit, it does worry me...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I haven't actually seen them for myself, but<<CRLF>>just hearing about those armored men advancing<<CRLF>>through the forest scares me.
I wonder if those outsiders in the village<<CRLF>>now...explorers, were they? I wonder if they<<CRLF>>know anything about what's going on.
It's going to be lonely without Karna around<<CRLF>>here. But I suppose it might be good for us<<CRLF>>to become more self-sufficient!
I'm nervous about what the future holds, but<<CRLF>>we just have to move ahead. There's no sense<<CRLF>>dwelling on the past.
There are a number of different quests on the<<CRLF>>board at the moment. I'd really appreciate it<<CRLF>>if you could work through some of them.
I'm sure the other villagers would be happy for<<CRLF>>your help, too.<<CRLF>>
It's hard enough to believe Asad was injured at<<CRLF>>all, much less by someone from the village...<<CRLF>>
How could such a thing even happen?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The village chief says not everyone from Romn<<CRLF>>is the same.<<CRLF>>
Still, whether they're trustworthy or not,<<CRLF>>I think we're better off not having anything<<CRLF>>to do with them.
So now there's a group of strangers swaggering<<CRLF>>through the forest...<<CRLF>>
I don't know what they want, but we're going to<<CRLF>>watch our backs, I think.<<CRLF>>
The Ancient Burrow is to the southwest of the<<CRLF>>village. Follow the path down the outer edge of<<CRLF>>the crater and you'll find the entrance.
It's full of dangerous insects, so if you're<<CRLF>>going inside, make certain you're on your guard!<<CRLF>>
I haven't really given the outside world much<<CRLF>>thought until recently.<<CRLF>>
Seems like it's more vast than I'd ever<<CRLF>>imagined.<<CRLF>>
Nothing we can do will turn back time. We have<<CRLF>>to accept that our way of life, as we've known<<CRLF>>it, may be coming to an end.
All we can do is focus on protecting those who<<CRLF>>are dear to us, and preserving our traditions<<CRLF>>as much as possible.

A while ago, a large group of people wearing<<CRLF>>tough-looking armor walked past the village<<CRLF>>and farther into the forest.
...And most of them were wearing masks similar<<CRLF>>to the ones worn during the incident.<<CRLF>>
I don't know what they're up to, but we must<<CRLF>>exercise the utmost caution.<<CRLF>>
I don't know what they're up to, but we must<<CRLF>>exercise the utmost caution.<<CRLF>>

Why are you bothering with all this when you<<CRLF>>could just run away?<<CRLF>>
Hmph. Well, do what you want. I'm still not<<CRLF>>going to trust you.<<CRLF>>
You're...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWere you guys with the search party<<CRLF>>yesterday?<<CRLF>>
Yes, but what business is it of yours?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWell, you know about the village being<<CRLF>>attacked yesterday, right?<<CRLF>>
#00101FWe're trying to hunt down the ones<<CRLF>>responsible.<<CRLF>>
...And what will you do when you find them?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You might not be imprisoned any more, but<<CRLF>>if you think we trust you now, you're sadly<<CRLF>>mistaken.
You could very well be the puppet-masters<<CRLF>>behind yesterday's incident, after all.<<CRLF>>
#00111FThis might be tougher than I thought...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

That's enough, Damlas.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
R-Ramon?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I hear they patrolled the village for the<<CRLF>>whole of the night.<<CRLF>>
And if they were allies of the masked ones who<<CRLF>>attacked us...<<CRLF>>
Why would they be coming to ask us for<<CRLF>>information?<<CRLF>>
W-well, that is true, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmph. Fine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I suppose it can't hurt to tell them what<<CRLF>>I know.<<CRLF>>
#00109FSo you do know something, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Maybe. I haven't got proof it's related to what<<CRLF>>happened, but it could be.<<CRLF>>
It was pitch black, so I couldn't see too well,<<CRLF>>but there was someone running through the forest<<CRLF>>at an unnaturally high speed.
And it certainly didn't look like any beast.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It was heading to the southwest of the village,<<CRLF>>to a place we call the Ancient Burrow.<<CRLF>>
#00101FThe Ancient Burrow?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You know about the big crater near here, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you climb down there, there's a cave full<<CRLF>>of violent insects.<<CRLF>>
We call it the Ancient Burrow.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FSeems like we got some pretty valuable<<CRLF>>intel!<<CRLF>>
#00100FCome on, Adol, let's go tell Karna what<<CRLF>>we've learned.<<CRLF>>
The village chief has been talking about the<<CRLF>>Romuns a lot lately.<<CRLF>>
Apparently they're a savage bunch who love<<CRLF>>invading other regions.<<CRLF>>
It doesn't seem like they mean to cause us any<<CRLF>>harm at the moment, but we can't be too careful.<<CRLF>>

It doesn't seem like they mean to cause us any<<CRLF>>harm at the moment, but we can't be too careful.<<CRLF>>
The masks those soldiers were wearing looked<<CRLF>>different from the one I was forced to wear,<<CRLF>>but its purpose was the same. I'm sure of it.
Means they've got something to do with that<<CRLF>>damned magician...<<CRLF>>
They're not going to catch me off guard like<<CRLF>>that ever again!<<CRLF>>
I wanted to go out hunting with Karna and the<<CRLF>>others, but I was told to stay here and rest.<<CRLF>>
Wearing that mask was the worst feeling of my<<CRLF>>life. I don't even want to think about it!<<CRLF>>
Being conscious the whole time, yet having no<<CRLF>>control over your body as you attack your<<CRLF>>friends... It was awful.

And if they were, were they acting of their<<CRLF>>own free will? I would venture a guess that<<CRLF>>they were not.

I've no idea how you managed to win over Asad,<<CRLF>>but I for one have no intention of welcoming an<<CRLF>>outsider into my home.
Please leave immediately.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm sorry, everyone.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Aww, leaving already? But you only just got<<CRLF>>here!<<CRLF>>
Greetings, Karna, Remnos, and...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wow, it's like his head's on fire!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thoth! Don't be rude!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. So, you're the outsider everyone's<<CRLF>>talking about, are you?<<CRLF>>
Welcome to our home.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmph. Who said anything about welcoming him?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wha...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've no idea how you managed to win over Asad,<<CRLF>>but I for one have no intention of welcoming an<<CRLF>>outsider into my home.
Please leave immediately.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But, dear...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Huh? What's wrong?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12006FUm... Well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FThis is Sadoc's home. Let's do as he<<CRLF>>says.<<CRLF>>
#00204FYeah. I guess it's...best not to tempt fate<<CRLF>>too much.<<CRLF>>
#00200FSorry for bothering you, Sadoc.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. Welcome.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This is the village community center, where<<CRLF>>everyone comes to make friends and be social.<<CRLF>>
Feel free to join us anytime you'd like!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Feel free to join us anytime you'd like!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, it's the red-haired outsider.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't care if you want to walk around town,<<CRLF>>but don't try anything funny.<<CRLF>>
Hmph. I'm never going to accept a man into<<CRLF>>Comodo who doesn't hunt.<<CRLF>>
Hmph. Forget it. I'm not interested in talking<<CRLF>>with you anymore.<<CRLF>>
Just know this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Until we've actually fought...you haven't<<CRLF>>beaten me.<<CRLF>>
Aren't you...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The red-haired outsider...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hah! Looks like you know your way around<<CRLF>>a sword, if nothing else.<<CRLF>>
But you don't seem particularly tough.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205FHmm... You sure about that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI wouldn't bet on you being able to win<<CRLF>>a fight against Adol.<<CRLF>>
Wha...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... if Karna says so, it's gotta be true!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
W-wait a minute...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We haven't fought! She's probably just trying<<CRLF>>to ingratiate herself with the outsider.<<CRLF>>
#12003FNow, now, calm down.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Calm down?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmph. It sure must be easy sitting around here<<CRLF>>all day, never bothering to hunt.<<CRLF>>
Listen here, Remnos.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've wanted to ask this for a long time,<<CRLF>>but...why don't you ever come out with us?<<CRLF>>
Whoa, Damlas, hold on...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Sorry, Ramon, but I've had enough of beating<<CRLF>>around the bush. I want an answer.<<CRLF>>
Why don't you ever come out and hunt with us?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're a man of Comodo! You're supposed to<<CRLF>>be a warrior!<<CRLF>>
#12006FHmm... Well, for better or for worse, I'm<<CRLF>>an artist and historian, not a hunter.<<CRLF>>
#12006FI'm not going to deny you your way of<<CRLF>>life. I completely respect it. It's just...not<<CRLF>>for me.
#12000FThat's all there is to it, really.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Grr... I don't get you at all...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12004FReally, how did we go from talking<<CRLF>>about Adol to talking about me?<<CRLF>>
#00205FYeah, I've got plenty I want to say to<<CRLF>>Remnos on this subject too.<<CRLF>>
#00201FBut can we at least not discuss it in front<<CRLF>>of Adol?<<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're right. I'm sorry.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmph. Forget it. I'm not interested anymore.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12006FSorry you had to see that, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12003FAnyway, let's go tour somewhere else,<<CRLF>>shall we?<<CRLF>>
#00205F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FHey, master. Mind if I show Adol around<<CRLF>>here a bit?<<CRLF>>
I don't mind... I never thought I'd see the day<<CRLF>>someone would come here from outside the<<CRLF>>forest!
#12003FHaha. You don't get visitors much more<<CRLF>>unique than this one.<<CRLF>>
#12000FThis is my master, Saisen. He's an artisan.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12000FHe looks a bit rough around the edges,<<CRLF>>but I assure you, he really does do<<CRLF>>beautiful work.
#00202FRemnos! That's no way to talk about your<<CRLF>>master!<<CRLF>>
Haha. Don't worry about it, Karna. I'm used to<<CRLF>>his sass-mouth.<<CRLF>>
#00204FHonestly! You spoil him, Saisen.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FBut he's right about one thing. You do<<CRLF>>some beautiful work. Remnos, too, even<<CRLF>>if he can't be respectful to his master!
#00211FI could never make anything half as nice<<CRLF>>as what you two can do.<<CRLF>>
#12006FWell, everyone has things they're good at<<CRLF>>and things they aren't.<<CRLF>>
#12006FLike me and hunting, for the latter.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Remember: Just because you're not great<<CRLF>>at something doesn't mean you have to<<CRLF>>give it up completely.
#00201FExactly! Listen to your master, Remnos.<<CRLF>>You used to come hunt with us, but then<<CRLF>>one day, you just stopped showing up!
#00201FI'm sure you'd be able to keep up with<<CRLF>>everyone if you trained.<<CRLF>>
#12000FWell, I just don't feel like putting all my<<CRLF>>effort into something to which I'm unsuited.<<CRLF>>
#12000FMoving on... Adol, take a look at this<<CRLF>>necklace.<<CRLF>>
#12003FI'm quite proud of this one. Isn't it<<CRLF>>beautiful?<<CRLF>>
It's very well-made.
Ehhh...
#12000FIsn't it just?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12003FI knew you'd appreciate it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12003FWe're going to be best friends, I'm sure<<CRLF>>of it! No...we already are!<<CRLF>>
#00211F*sigh* Look at him getting carried away.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12004FWh-what?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12002FCan't you appreciate its beauty? I was<<CRLF>>sure I could count on you, Adol!<<CRLF>>
#00203FHeheh. It's very nice, Remnos. Cheer up,<<CRLF>>now!<<CRLF>>
Haha. You sure seem to be having fun.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Know that you're always welcome to come<<CRLF>>back and look around, as much as you'd like.<<CRLF>>
Make yourself at home here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Know that you're always welcome to come<<CRLF>>back and look around, as much as you'd like.<<CRLF>>

#12100FHave you finished your tour?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12100FYou may not get another chance like this.<<CRLF>>I'd suggest taking your time and enjoying<<CRLF>>what our village has to offer.
#4CVarious quests are displayed on the board.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp2301.JSON_TEXT 66 >>
#00200FWe're here, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FWe call this place the Ancient Burrow.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FDoes seem like the perfect place to use<<CRLF>>as a hideout. It's so quiet...<<CRLF>>
#00101FVillagers would never notice them here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F...Let's go inside.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...Karna, what's wrong?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FI think they know we're here already.<<CRLF>>Someone's coming!<<CRLF>>
#00101FTch. Guess we just walked right into an<<CRLF>>ambush.<<CRLF>>
#00101FLooks like this is no time for scouting<<CRLF>>out the area, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00202FEveryone, we've come to rescue you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FLet's go back home! Back to Comodo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Masked Warrior
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FWhat's wrong? Why don't you say<<CRLF>>something?!<<CRLF>>
Something's not right here.
Let's be cautious.
#00101FYeah, they don't even seem to know<<CRLF>>they're being spoken to. It's just like<<CRLF>>when they attacked Comodo.
#00101FI don't even think they're acting of their<<CRLF>>own will.<<CRLF>>
#00104F...Could someone be controlling them?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, we'd better be careful.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThis is just like when they attacked<<CRLF>>Comodo.<<CRLF>>
#00104F...Could someone be controlling them?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FWh-why...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FLooks like we can't just talk our way<<CRLF>>out of this one.<<CRLF>>
#00202F...It seems not. We have to stand and<<CRLF>>fight. Cover me, please!<<CRLF>>
#00209FOh, their masks...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThere's no way normal people can be this<<CRLF>>strong.<<CRLF>>
#00101FThe masks definitely have something to<<CRLF>>do with it, but I have no idea how they<<CRLF>>work.
#2WI-is that you...Karna?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FAre you okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2WI'm...so sorry...<<CRLF>>The mask, it...<<CRLF>>
#00104FGuess that really was it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2WHe's...inside...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2W...Help...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FWho? Who's inside?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2W...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FHe's out cold.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Let's go.
We should stay and look after them.
#00209F...B-but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAdol's right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThere aren't any dangerous beasts or<<CRLF>>anything around, so they should be fine.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's let them rest here and head inside.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHmm... Their wounds don't seem very<<CRLF>>serious. They should be okay.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThere aren't any dangerous creatures<<CRLF>>around, so I think it's safe to leave them.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's let them rest here and head inside.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FO-okay. If you say so...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FUh-oh, looks like a dead end.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FWait! Look at that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FIt looks like some kind of beast's cocoon.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FAnd it's only being supported by a single<<CRLF>>thread...<<CRLF>>
#00200FI should be able to cut it down with one<<CRLF>>of my knives.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOh, I see! We cut it down and use it to<<CRLF>>walk across, right?<<CRLF>>
#00200FYeah. But I don't think I can hit it from<<CRLF>>here. The angle is all wrong.<<CRLF>>
#00200FLet's try heading for higher ground.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CHe's unconscious, but his life doesn't seem to be in any danger.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#4CShe's unconscious, but her life doesn't seem to be in any danger.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp2303.JSON_TEXT 2 >>
#00100FLooks like...some kind of ancient treasure?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI can feel a strange power coming off of it.<<CRLF>>It's just gathering dust here, so we might<<CRLF>>as well put it to good use, right?
<< mp2309.JSON_TEXT 18 >>
#00109FThis is one huge door.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FHmm... Has some kinda hole in it. Maybe<<CRLF>>you're supposed to put something in there,<<CRLF>>like a sort of key.
#00101FPretty complicated locking mechanism,<<CRLF>>but should be a piece of cake to get open,<<CRLF>>if we've got something that'll fit!
#00109FThis is just like that other door we found.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FHas the same kinda hole in it, too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FI guess it's opened the same way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FWe did it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FHmm? What's that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FSound familiar to you, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's harp music.
I've heard this melody before.
#00109FA harp? Huh... This is actually the first<<CRLF>>time I've ever heard one.<<CRLF>>
#00108F...Wait a minute, a harp?! Didn't...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FI've heard this song so many times before,<<CRLF>>ever since I was a little girl...<<CRLF>>
#00204FIt's Remnos. I'd recognize the melody<<CRLF>>and the sound of that instrument any-<<CRLF>>where!
#00109FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FI'm coming, Remnos. Just hang in there...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp2310.JSON_TEXT 77 >>
#00208FWh-what's going on here...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FIsn't he the one who hurt your dad back<<CRLF>>in Comodo?<<CRLF>>
#00204F...Are you really the one who fought<<CRLF>>with Father?<<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SAnswer me, Remnos!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Masked Man
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FHmph. You wanna fight, huh? This is<<CRLF>>starting to look awful familiar...<<CRLF>>
#00108FWh-whaaaa? How did he do that?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#1MUgh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*huff* *huff* Looks like we won,<<CRLF>>somehow...<<CRLF>>
#00111FBut this guy's way stronger than any of<<CRLF>>the others...<<CRLF>>
Who are you?
Take that mask off.
Masked Man
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FLooks like he's not saying a word.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Masked Man
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWell if you're not gonna take it off, I<<CRLF>>guess we'll just have to--<<CRLF>>
#00201FI'll do it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102F#0MWh-whoa...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00110F#16S#0MWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400F#0725V*chuckle* You've served me well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400F#0726VAfter seeing the mask's power, I'd call<<CRLF>>this experiment a success.<<CRLF>>
#00202F...Who are you?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10405F#0727VWho am I? I don't see why I should<<CRLF>>introduce myself to the likes of you...<<CRLF>>
#10400F#0728VBut I'm in such a wonderful mood today,<<CRLF>>I'll grant you your wish.<<CRLF>>
#10400F#2M#0729VI am Bami...a magician who controls<<CRLF>>people using the darkness in their own<<CRLF>>hearts.
#00109FA magician...who controls people? So<<CRLF>>that's what the masks do?<<CRLF>>
#10400F...Oh, don't go jumping to conclusions.<<CRLF>>I wasn't finished talking, you know. And<<CRLF>>it's quite rude to interrupt a lady!
#10400FIn point of fact, the mask isn't what's<<CRLF>>controlling him at all. Rather, that would<<CRLF>>be my magic. Observe!
#12010F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#16S#0MRemnos!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWell, if you're the one controlling him,<<CRLF>>then what's the mask for?<<CRLF>>
#00101FAnd don't you dare say you made him<<CRLF>>wear it because you like the way it looks!<<CRLF>>
#10405FThe masks are a necessary part of an...<<CRLF>>experiment that has been assigned to me.<<CRLF>>
#10405FIt seems they have the ability to greatly<<CRLF>>increase a person's physical abilities.<<CRLF>>
#00109FA strength-boosting mask, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FI guess that explains how Remnos could<<CRLF>>pull off moves like that even when he's<<CRLF>>not a warrior.
#00204FNo, there's still something off about this...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat do you mean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The strength increase is too drastic.
Where did that woman come from?
#00204FThat's exactly it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FThat's true, it is surprising that someone<<CRLF>>other than you two came from outside<<CRLF>>the forest.
#00201FBut I was actually referring to Remnos'<<CRLF>>strength.<<CRLF>>
#00201FThe Remnos I know isn't even as strong<<CRLF>>as those four we fought earlier.<<CRLF>>
#00201FYet, he was still able...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FOh, I think I see what you mean.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FEven with the mask, he still shouldn't<<CRLF>>be able to defeat your dad or control<<CRLF>>giant monsters or anything like that.
#10405F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10405FYou three don't know anything about this<<CRLF>>poor boy, do you?<<CRLF>>
#00202FWh-what are you talking about?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10405FHe's a naturally gifted warrior, much more<<CRLF>>capable in battle than you can possibly<<CRLF>>imagine.
#10400FEven without the mask... See?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00212F#00185V#16SAah!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102F#16SKarna!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FH-how...?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MYou still don't understand? Very well. I suppose<<CRLF>>I'll just have to be the one to teach you, then.<<CRLF>>
#0MHe's always kept his true capabilities hidden<<CRLF>>from others. Now why do you suppose he'd do<<CRLF>>a thing like that?
#0MMaybe so he wouldn't hurt his poor, hard-working<<CRLF>>older sister by letting her find out how much<<CRLF>>more talented he is!
#0M#00734V#16SHahaha...HAHAHAHAHA!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FWh-what are you--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400FI am a magician who can find the dark-<<CRLF>>ness in people's hearts and use it to<<CRLF>>control them.
#10400FAnd he is the latest whose darkness I've<<CRLF>>chosen to manipulate. That is all.<<CRLF>>
#10403FI give you my deepest sympathies. Having<<CRLF>>a younger brother who's too skilled for his<<CRLF>>own good brings nothing but trouble.
#00101FUgh, this woman...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're twisted.
Are you from outside the Great Forest?
#10400FTeehee. Why, thank you. I'll take that as<<CRLF>>a compliment!<<CRLF>>
#10400FHee. Of course! I'm almost offended<<CRLF>>that you'd think someone like I could<<CRLF>>come from this backwoods region.
#10405FI believe I've talked for long enough.<<CRLF>>There is far too much left for me to do<<CRLF>>to keep playing with you any longer.
#00202FRemnos?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400FStill, I must thank you for one thing.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400FI hadn't imagined I'd find something so...<<CRLF>>useful...in a place like this.<<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SW-wait!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SLet him go! GIVE HIM BACK!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#4CThe presence of beasts can no longer be felt in the surrounding<<CRLF>>area. The air is still and tranquil...<<CRLF>>
#4CEnveloped in the clear air of the forest and the fragrance of the<<CRLF>>spirit tree, Adol felt his body drift into a deep, relaxing slumber...<<CRLF>>
#4COne of the memories sealed in the back of Adol's mind was<<CRLF>>restored!<<CRLF>>
#00100FLooks like you remembered something<<CRLF>>else. What was it this time?<<CRLF>>
I was talking to a young blond man.
I was riding a beast on the river.
#00109FGuess that means there really are<<CRLF>>people living in this forest.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSounds like it's somebody different from<<CRLF>>the voice you described at the mine, too.<<CRLF>>
#00100FEither way, it's a pretty encouraging sign.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe should be getting to the river I marked<<CRLF>>on the map very soon now. Let's see what<<CRLF>>we find there.
#00109FA blond-haired man? Not someone from<<CRLF>>Comodo, then?<<CRLF>>
#00100FWonder if it's someone from that settle-<<CRLF>>ment at the river that Asad told us about...<<CRLF>>
#00100FShould be almost there now, so I guess<<CRLF>>we'll find out soon enough!<<CRLF>>
#00109FRiding a beast?! Wow...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FWell...if you were able to ride it, that<<CRLF>>means it was tame, right? So some-<<CRLF>>body's gotta be there to have tamed it.
#00111FCan't help but think of all those big, scary<<CRLF>>beasts we keep running into, though.<<CRLF>>
#00103FBy the way, we should be almost there<<CRLF>>by now.<<CRLF>>

Aaah, this place really does have an<<CRLF>>amazing view! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
It'd be even more perfect if I could drink, but<<CRLF>>getting drunk in the Great Forest really doesn't<<CRLF>>seem like a good idea.
So those are the Primeval Lands on<<CRLF>>the other side of the river...but how am I<<CRLF>>supposed to get over there?
Ahhhhh, the treasure hunter blood in me is<<CRLF>>burning with the heat of a thousand suns!<<CRLF>>
It's so frustrating to be stuck here when<<CRLF>>there's a mysterious tower like that right<<CRLF>>in front of my eyes...
If this is as far as we can go, maybe I<<CRLF>>should consider giving up on Celceta<<CRLF>>and heading somewhere else.
I made it all the way to Selray, but I can't<<CRLF>>find any means of crossing the river.<<CRLF>>
There has to be a way, though! I won't give up!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That looks like some kind of settlement...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
A settlement on the river...<<CRLF>>I should go take a closer look.<<CRLF>>

...Why am I such a coward?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I really want to find a way across the river,<<CRLF>>for Swan as well as for myself.<<CRLF>>
But where am I even supposed to start looking?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Swan's really someone you can rely on.<<CRLF>>Plus, she's gorgeous...<<CRLF>>
...Wait, what am I thinking?! She's my partner!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What happened? Why is there suddenly no mist<<CRLF>>on the other side of the river?<<CRLF>>
And what's that tower? So many questions...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThe wild Spardas' habitat is to the south<<CRLF>>of Selray. This is the wrong direction.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOops, looks like we strayed too far from<<CRLF>>the river. Best head back to it and take<<CRLF>>care to follow it more closely.
#4CThere appears to be a spirit tree sapling in this area. It would be<<CRLF>>best to pitch a tent and rest before continuing.<<CRLF>>

<< mp3102.JSON_TEXT 27 >>
#00300F...This is the place.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FSo this is the sacred beasts' lair, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThought it'd be more like a nest, being<<CRLF>>a beasts' lair and all. Didn't expect full-on<<CRLF>>ruins.
#00100FYou come here often, Ozma?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...I try to avoid coming here as much as<<CRLF>>possible.<<CRLF>>
#00305FParticularly as this is the place where I<<CRLF>>lost my mother and father. I cannot say I<<CRLF>>have very fond memories of it.
#00109FReally?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FAll of the Spardas raised in Selray were<<CRLF>>captured here when they were infants.<<CRLF>>
#00300FMy parents were killed by the poison of<<CRLF>>an adult Sparda while attempting to trap<<CRLF>>its young.
#00300F...But I cannot let the people of Selray<<CRLF>>know that.<<CRLF>>
Why not?
Why do you bear this burden alone?
#00305FIt is to protect the laws of my tribe.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...Because I am the last of my tribe.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThe laws essentially forbid me from<<CRLF>>telling the people of my village the truth<<CRLF>>about these creatures.
#00300FHow could I reveal to them that two in<<CRLF>>our ranks -- a tribe that cares for beasts<<CRLF>>-- were killed by those very beasts?
#00109F...Do you really need to go that far to<<CRLF>>keep it all a secret, though?<<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI get that the Spardas are essential to<<CRLF>>everyday life in Selray.<<CRLF>>
#00100FBut surely it'd be better if everybody<<CRLF>>worked together to care for them, right?<<CRLF>>
#00100FIt's gotta hurt keeping this all to yourself.<<CRLF>>Do you really think you can keep it up?<<CRLF>>
#00300F...The laws of my tribe are absolute.<<CRLF>>There is nothing I can do about them.<<CRLF>>
#00105F*sigh* It's like talking to a brick wall...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThe wild Spardas' habitat is to the south<<CRLF>>of Selray. This is the wrong direction.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOops, guess we strayed too far from the<<CRLF>>river! Better head back and regain our<<CRLF>>bearings.
#00100FHold on, this leads back into the forest!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe made it all the way to the river, so we<<CRLF>>should really finish up here before going<<CRLF>>anywhere else.
<< mp3103.JSON_TEXT 26 >>
#00300FAccording to Adol's journal, the entrance<<CRLF>>to the underground ruins should be around<<CRLF>>here.
#00209F...Adol came here pretty recently, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Is something the matter?
Are you hungry?
#00201FNo, it's nothing.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203F...Probably just overthinking.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FA little. But it's okay. I'm fine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FI just...noticed something, I guess?<<CRLF>>But I'm probably just overthinking.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOkay, let's see if we can find something<<CRLF>>that looks like an entrance.<<CRLF>>
#00209FWhat's this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIt appears to be a unique mechanism.<<CRLF>>Without knowing its function, however,<<CRLF>>we should exercise caution.
#00105FHold on... I think I've seen this some-<<CRLF>>where before.<<CRLF>>
#00109F...That's right, it was in Adol's notebook!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FThere was a picture in there that looked<<CRLF>>just like this.<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol took out his journal.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FLet's see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104F#2M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100F#2MHere we go. Right here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309F#2MHmm... The pattern of differently-shaded<<CRLF>>diamonds is indeed strikingly similar to<<CRLF>>the picture here.
#00100F#2MAll right, Adol, time to get thinking.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4C-Underground Ruins Puzzle-
#4CSelect a diamond-shaped depression and press #0B or\nclick to light/unlight that depression as well as all others\nlocated immediately up, down, left, and right from it.
#00210FIt opened!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FSo that was the solution...<<CRLF>>I have never seen such a thing as this<<CRLF>>before.
#00100FC'mon, everybody, let's see what's<<CRLF>>inside!<<CRLF>>
<< mp3103m.JSON_TEXT 15 >>
#14005F#1MI'm terribly sorry for surprising you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000F#1MYour name is Adol Christin, is it not?<<CRLF>>I've been searching all over for you.<<CRLF>>
#14000F#1MMy name is Leeza, and I was sent to find<<CRLF>>you. Consider me...an escort.<<CRLF>>
#14001FE-erm... As I said, he's been handed down<<CRLF>>in my family for generations.<<CRLF>>
#14009FHow many? I'm sorry, I'm afraid I haven't<<CRLF>>been told any such specific details.<<CRLF>>
#14000FYes, there's a town called Highland.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14012FU-um, Adol? I can tell that you have<<CRLF>>many questions you'd like me to answer,<<CRLF>>but we really should be leaving.
#14000FCould... Could I ask you to climb onto<<CRLF>>Sol now?<<CRLF>>
#14000FWe can talk while we travel.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FA present from the Masked Division?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10603FYeah. Some delicious-looking mushrooms!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10009FHmmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10500FThey brought them to us earlier. Maybe<<CRLF>>that means they've finally accepted us!<<CRLF>>
#10503FHow about we cook these up tonight,<<CRLF>>so we can build some strength for the<<CRLF>>coming mission?
#10005F...All right. I suppose we could do that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp3104.JSON_TEXT 69 >>
#00109FAdol, look at that statue!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've never seen anything like it.
I've seen a statue like this before.
#00111F...Are you serious?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FIt looks just like the statue you heard<<CRLF>>that voice from in Casnia Mine!<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, in Casnia Mine. You said you heard<<CRLF>>a voice coming from it.<<CRLF>>
#00101FWho'd have thought we'd find another<<CRLF>>one like it here?<<CRLF>>
#00201F...I've seen a statue like this near<<CRLF>>Comodo, too.<<CRLF>>
#00300FIt is said that many hundreds of years ago<<CRLF>>there was a giant settlement in this area,<<CRLF>>large enough to be called a 'kingdom.'
#00109FA kingdom? Say, Adol, didn't you say<<CRLF>>you heard something like that from<<CRLF>>Remnos, too?
He said it existed about 800 years ago.
He said it existed about 900 years ago.
#00201FThat's right. Eight hundred years ago.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FNo, I'm pretty sure it was a little later.<<CRLF>>Eight hundred years, if I'm not mistaken.<<CRLF>>
#00200FHe was really fascinated by stories of it,<<CRLF>>and always trying to research more about<<CRLF>>it as inspiration for his poems.
#00200F...Although he wound up researching it in<<CRLF>>private since Father and I were criticizing<<CRLF>>him just a little too much.
#00100FSo these are the remains of an ancient<<CRLF>>kingdom, then?<<CRLF>>
#00300FThey may be connected to the Primeval<<CRLF>>Lands, as well.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOkay...what are we waiting for?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That man has no sense of decorum at all.<<CRLF>>Can't he tell this isn't the time or place<<CRLF>>for that sort of thing?
...It's up to me to stay on guard.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Perhaps the news has spread that this<<CRLF>>area's been sealed off, as the number of<<CRLF>>explorers coming here has decreased.
It's made my job a lot easier.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The other day, I accidentally let two explorers<<CRLF>>past.<<CRLF>>
Naturally, I suffered one of the longest<<CRLF>>lectures in my entire career as a result.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* Why me...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, you must be Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This ruin has been sealed off and placed under<<CRLF>>the control of the Celcetan Army by order of<<CRLF>>Governor General Griselda.
However, she has also ordered us to make a<<CRLF>>special exception for you, specifically.<<CRLF>>
Just please take care when inside.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Governor General Griselda has ordered us to<<CRLF>>allow you safe passage.<<CRLF>>
Just please take care when inside.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#20SYodelay-ee-hooooo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#18SYodelay-ee-hooooo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14SYodelay-ee-hooooo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12SYooodeeelaaay-eeee-hoooooo...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. Sorry, did I surprise you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I was just wondering whether my voice<<CRLF>>would echo here, so I decided to give it<<CRLF>>a go.
#20SYodelay-ee-hooooo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#18SYodelay-ee-hooooo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14SYodelay-ee-hooooo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12SYooodeeelaaay-eeee-hoooooo...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You should give it a try! It's pretty fun.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* It's really lonely standing guard in an<<CRLF>>empty place like this.<<CRLF>>
I can't wait for my shift to end so I can go<<CRLF>>back to camp.<<CRLF>>
Those two explorers seemed so muddled in the<<CRLF>>head and generally incompetent that I let my<<CRLF>>guard down.
*sigh* Why did this have to happen?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Those two explorers have been glaring at me for<<CRLF>>a while now.<<CRLF>>
I do understand how they feel, but we have our<<CRLF>>orders.<<CRLF>>
It is a bit unreasonable not to allow anyone<<CRLF>>past this point, I can't deny.<<CRLF>>
But we have our orders from the Governor<<CRLF>>General, so there's nothing I can do about it.<<CRLF>>
Here's the plan, Pigeon. You're going to be the<<CRLF>>decoy, and while you're attracting attention,<<CRLF>>I'll run in!
H-hang on a minute! Even if this plan works,<<CRLF>>what's going to happen to me?<<CRLF>>
And if we get caught here, we're going to lose<<CRLF>>the right to get any reward money at all!<<CRLF>>
I wouldn't have expected to find a ruin here.<<CRLF>>I wonder why the Romuns sealed it off...<<CRLF>>
It... It doesn't lead to the Primeval Lands,<<CRLF>>does it?<<CRLF>>
Maybe it does, and they've found something there<<CRLF>>they feel compelled to keep hidden...<<CRLF>>
...I suppose that's not very likely, though.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wouldn't have expected to find a ruin here.<<CRLF>>I wonder why the Romuns sealed it off...<<CRLF>>
Well, whatever the reason may be, I can't<<CRLF>>explore with them around, so I'd best just<<CRLF>>move along.
This is an amazing ruin...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I suppose it was built by the people of the<<CRLF>>ancient Kingdom of Celceta. It really is<<CRLF>>stunning...
Apparently, that dumb explorer duo passed here<<CRLF>>a while ago.<<CRLF>>
I can't believe they'd oppose the Romuns just to<<CRLF>>get a look inside some ruins!<<CRLF>>
Their stupidity knows no limits.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I can't believe that explorer duo would oppose<<CRLF>>the Romuns just to get a look inside some ruins!<<CRLF>>

#4CA winged statue stands silently before you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp3104m.JSON_TEXT 23 >>
#10225FThat's the basic outline of our invasion<<CRLF>>plans for Highland.<<CRLF>>
#10220FIncidentally, I have no objections if you<<CRLF>>wish to finish that Leo off. He's harmless<<CRLF>>enough, but he's become a nuisance.
#10401FWould that be wise?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10405FWe wouldn't want his death to cause us<<CRLF>>any trouble later.<<CRLF>>
#10300FHah. He's headin' into dangerous territory.<<CRLF>>Nothin' suspicious about kickin' off in a<<CRLF>>place like that.
#10224FPrecisely. We can accomplish this without<<CRLF>>anyone suspecting a thing.<<CRLF>>
#10406FIf that's what you wish.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Commander Remnos
#12025F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FCretin! What's the meaning of this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Commander Remnos
#12020FHmm? What do you mean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FIn my younger, poorer days, there was a<<CRLF>>time when I could only afford to eat<<CRLF>>mountain mushrooms.
#10005FAnd thanks to that, I'm something of an<<CRLF>>expert on them.<<CRLF>>
#10001F...So I can say with some certainty that<<CRLF>>those are poisonous mushrooms.<<CRLF>>
Commander Remnos
#12029F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FNot particularly dangerous ones, however.<<CRLF>>They wouldn't kill you...just give you a<<CRLF>>light stomach ache.
#10001FWhy would you send something like that<<CRLF>>to us?<<CRLF>>
Commander Remnos
#12026FI'm sure I don't know what you're talking<<CRLF>>about.<<CRLF>>
#10001F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FHmph. Insolent child...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp3105.JSON_TEXT 114 >>
#00109FThis place is even more amazing up close<<CRLF>>than it was from the plateau.<<CRLF>>
#00100FNever would've imagined people actually<<CRLF>>lived in the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSeems like they're using the river as a<<CRLF>>natural sort of protection against monsters.<<CRLF>>
#00100FPeople sure can adapt to any situation,<<CRLF>>huh?<<CRLF>>
#00100FSame goes for Comodo. I seriously can't<<CRLF>>imagine seeing anything like this outside<<CRLF>>the Great Forest.
#00100FThink we can safely assume this river's<<CRLF>>the one we heard about.<<CRLF>>
Hey, you two!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Don't just stand there, you'll lure the<<CRLF>>monsters!<<CRLF>>
Come into the village where it's safe.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
W-w-wait, you're...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#18SOh, this is not good!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FUh-oh. I don't like where this is going.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...Adol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FI'm getting a real case of deja vu here...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, you with the red hair! You've got some<<CRLF>>nerve showing your face here again!<<CRLF>>
#16SIt's your fault we can't fish anymore!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Don't you dare think we'll let you get away<<CRLF>>with it, either! This village could be on its last<<CRLF>>legs thanks to you!
#00109FWh-what?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FThey don't seem too happy with you,<<CRLF>>Adol... What the hell did you do?<<CRLF>>
I have no idea.
I might have a very faint idea...
#00111FSomehow, I don't think they're going to<<CRLF>>believe you...<<CRLF>>
#00111FOh boy, give me a break...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* Figures...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FCome on, Adol, hurry and remember<<CRLF>>whatever it is you screwed up!<<CRLF>>
I have no idea.
I might have a very faint idea...
#00111FI had a feeling you'd say that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* Oh well, no point crying over spilled<<CRLF>>memories. Let's just get this over with.<<CRLF>>
#00101FReally? Well, speed it up so you can<<CRLF>>clear my name, then!<<CRLF>>
#10002FHalt, men! We have reached our<<CRLF>>destination: the river!<<CRLF>>
#10604FFINALLY!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10501FThat misty peak was a nightmare. You<<CRLF>>sure we didn't need to write down which<<CRLF>>way we went?
#10000FFools! Men with my intelligence have no<<CRLF>>need for notes!<<CRLF>>
#10501FBut we'll have to go through it again on<<CRLF>>the way back, won't we?<<CRLF>>
#10010F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FMy fame is a result of my hard work,<<CRLF>>effort and strength of mind!<<CRLF>>
#10002FI will smash through any obstacle or<<CRLF>>challenge that stands in my way!<<CRLF>>
#10003F#00924V#16SWaahahahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10601FSlowly... Slowly...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FThe most valuable rewards in life come<<CRLF>>from hard work and perseverance!<<CRLF>>
#10009F...Hey! where did you go?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FWhere are you?! Answer me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sancho's Voice
We've persevered enough for a whole lifetime<<CRLF>>just following you this far! We can't take it<<CRLF>>anymore!
#10002F#16SCome back here! Come back, I say!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FMan, can't believe they actually made it<<CRLF>>across that peak..<<CRLF>>
#00100FThey're persistent, I'll give 'em that!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAnyway...looks like we finished mapping<<CRLF>>the area around the river.<<CRLF>>
#00100FStill haven't explored the area around the<<CRLF>>big tree yet, though, so we'd better head<<CRLF>>there next.
#10009FHmph. You're that Adol fellow from the<<CRLF>>other day.<<CRLF>>
#10001FYou fiend, getting ahead of me not once,<<CRLF>>but twice!<<CRLF>>
#10000FConsider this the last time, though.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10000FFrom now on, the glory will be all mine!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Commander Leo, a carrier pigeon has arrived<<CRLF>>from Governor General Griselda bearing an<<CRLF>>urgent message.
She's ordered our return to Casnan at once!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FGrrrr... We only just got here! What does<<CRLF>>she want now?!<<CRLF>>
#10002F#16S...Fine. Sancho! Panza! Get back here<<CRLF>>right this instant!<<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SWe're returning to Casnan!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FReminds me of a story I heard at the bar<<CRLF>>once.<<CRLF>>
#00105FSeems he was a pretty famous general at<<CRLF>>one point. People used to call him 'Roaring<<CRLF>>Leo.'
#00111FI dunno what he's doing in Celceta, but<<CRLF>>he's got enough enthusiasm and energy<<CRLF>>for the whole army.
#00100FAnyway...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FMight be a good idea for us to head back<<CRLF>>to Casnan ourselves.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLooks like we've finished the map as far<<CRLF>>as the river. And something's obviously<<CRLF>>got the army all fired up over there...
#00100FPlus, we should probably report in with<<CRLF>>the Governor General. So what do you<<CRLF>>say? Head back to the city?
Okay.
I want to go somewhere else first.
#00103FAll right. Onward to Casnan, then!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FReally?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FOkay. We'll head back whenever you're<<CRLF>>ready, then.<<CRLF>>
Hey, if it isn't Adol and Duren! Welcome back.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks to you, there hasn't been any poison in<<CRLF>>the river at all for quite a while.<<CRLF>>
We still haven't managed to catch the culprit,<<CRLF>>though...<<CRLF>>
#00101FI'm not too surprised. He didn't seem like<<CRLF>>the type to make it easy for anyone.<<CRLF>>
There have been others coming and going here,<<CRLF>>too, aside from you guys.<<CRLF>>
Right now, that Leo fellow who's been here once<<CRLF>>before is inside the village.<<CRLF>>
He keeps complaining about how he wants to<<CRLF>>cross the river.<<CRLF>>
Since you're here, you should go see Ozma.<<CRLF>>I'm sure he'd be thrilled for the visit.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's go, Adol. To Ozma's place first.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FWe should introduce Karna, too, while<<CRLF>>we're here.<<CRLF>>
Selray can't stay the same forever. But I must<<CRLF>>admit, I never thought the day would come when<<CRLF>>I'd actually believe that.
Dealing with people from the outside is<<CRLF>>likely to become more common now, so I'd<<CRLF>>best get used to the idea.
Right now, a messenger from Romn is making an<<CRLF>>announcement in the village square.<<CRLF>>
He says he came here to let us know that the<<CRLF>>Romuns mean us no harm, but I really can't bring<<CRLF>>myself to trust him...
I wonder if the fact that we haven't heard<<CRLF>>anything from those Romuns who passed through<<CRLF>>means they've made it to the Primeval Lands.
Maybe they have something to do with the<<CRLF>>sudden disappearance of the mist from the<<CRLF>>opposite shore...
The other day, a group of Romuns wearing<<CRLF>>strange masks passed by.<<CRLF>>
They didn't so much as look at us. In fact,<<CRLF>>I don't believe they even spoke one word among<<CRLF>>them. It was a very creepy sight.
I still can't believe Ozma's going with you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But I can rest easy knowing he's in good<<CRLF>>company, at least. Take care of him for us,<<CRLF>>Adol.
No matter how hard I try, I can't forget that<<CRLF>>Romun soldier's...unique hairstyle.<<CRLF>>
Leo, was it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Okay, calm down...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I didn't say anything about not letting you into<<CRLF>>the village, I just need to check with...<<CRLF>>
...Aaand, they're not listening.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, redhead...I mean, Adol. I'm truly sorry<<CRLF>>for everything we've put you through.<<CRLF>>
We didn't even consider the possibility that<<CRLF>>someone other than you had come here from<<CRLF>>outside the forest.
We're going to have to keep our guard up from<<CRLF>>now on.<<CRLF>>
We didn't even consider the possibility that<<CRLF>>someone other than you had come here from<<CRLF>>outside the forest.
We're going to have to keep our guard up from<<CRLF>>now on.<<CRLF>>
Take care if you're going out, Ozma.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We're always here if you need us.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FFools, listen to me! Listen, I say!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FHow could you even think of attempting<<CRLF>>to go on ahead without your Commander?!<<CRLF>>I won't stand for it!
#10002FFools, listen to me! Listen, I say!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FI told you, we're heading back to Casnan!<<CRLF>>Now!<<CRLF>>
#10501FP-please, just let us rest for a while in<<CRLF>>the village...<<CRLF>>
#10501FJust a little while! We'll be gone before<<CRLF>>you know it.<<CRLF>>
#10604FCome on! Why won't you let us inside?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FWe mean you no harm! Honest!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't know what to say about this whole<<CRLF>>situation.<<CRLF>>
I think I'll just stay out of it and watch.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol's base STR increased by 1.
<< mp3201.JSON_TEXT 694 >>
#00300FAs promised, I have explained the sit-<<CRLF>>uation to all of the villagers.<<CRLF>>
#00300FAnd I have asked them to cooperate with<<CRLF>>your investigation, so do speak your<<CRLF>>mind on any questions you may have.
#00111FKinda makes me nervous, seeing as we<<CRLF>>haven't proven our innocence yet...<<CRLF>>
#00100FKay, let's go see if we can find any<<CRLF>>clues.<<CRLF>>
#00100FI think we got enough information to start<<CRLF>>with, at least.<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's go through what we know and see<<CRLF>>if we can sort it out, okay?<<CRLF>>
#00100FFirst, let's see... When did the villagers<<CRLF>>first notice the poison?<<CRLF>>
Before I left.
After I left.
#00111F...Really? Don't remember anyone saying<<CRLF>>anything like that. Have another think.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWhen did the villagers first notice the<<CRLF>>poison?<<CRLF>>
#00105FYeah, they noticed it just after you left<<CRLF>>Selray.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd that's why you're getting blamed for<<CRLF>>it.<<CRLF>>
#00100FNext question is, how did they notice it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Foul odor from the river.
The river was dyed red.
#00111FCome on, Adol, I know I'm not one to<<CRLF>>talk here, but be serious, will you?!<<CRLF>>
#00100FHow did they notice the poison?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah, seems whatever was in there<<CRLF>>colored the water red. Must've been a<<CRLF>>hell of a thing to see!
#00100FAnd where did the poison originate from?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Around the village.
Upstream.
#00111FReally? Don't remember anyone telling us<<CRLF>>that...<<CRLF>>
#00100FHave another think. Where did the poison<<CRLF>>originate from?<<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah, that's right. And if it came from<<CRLF>>upstream, it must have come from some-<<CRLF>>where outside of Selray.
#00100F...All right, Adol. If you add all that<<CRLF>>together, who stands out as the most likely<<CRLF>>culprit?
It was me. It had to be!
It was someone from the village.
It wasn't a person at all...
#00111FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAren't we doing all this to prove you<<CRLF>>DIDN'T poison the waters around here?!<<CRLF>>
#00100FI'll ask again: what makes the most sense<<CRLF>>based on everything we've heard?<<CRLF>>
#00105FThat wouldn't make sense, would it?<<CRLF>>This village needs fish to survive. Who<<CRLF>>would poison their only food source?
#00105FThe fishermen we asked were all horrified.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThere's no way anyone from here would<<CRLF>>do something like that.<<CRLF>>
#00309F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...What leads you to that conclusion?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FIt makes sense, when you think about it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FYou'd need a whole lot of poison to dye<<CRLF>>an entire river red.<<CRLF>>
#00104FAnd if it came from upstream, that would<<CRLF>>mean someone poured it into the river from<<CRLF>>somewhere outside the village.
#00100FNo way anyone can lug that much poison<<CRLF>>through monster-infested woodlands. Not<<CRLF>>on their own, like Adol woulda been!
#00100FI mean, I'm not saying it'd be impossible<<CRLF>>to poison the water from upstream, but<<CRLF>>to dye the whole river red? Not likely!
#00300F...It does seem rather implausible.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FSo your conclusion, then, is that the<<CRLF>>culprit may be a natural occurrence, or<<CRLF>>a creature?
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FAdol and...you said your name was Duren,<<CRLF>>yes? Could I ask you to come with me?<<CRLF>>
#00100FI can't believe he's looking after an entire<<CRLF>>village at his age.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat must be one hell of a weight on his<<CRLF>>shoulders. If we get a chance, we should<<CRLF>>check in on him again sometime.
#4CYou can now accept quests in Selray.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI believe all of my preparations are now<<CRLF>>complete.<<CRLF>>
#00300FIt feels strange to be leaving my home<<CRLF>>on a journey for the first time.<<CRLF>>
#00203FOh, believe me, I know right where you're<<CRLF>>coming from!<<CRLF>>
#00203FIt's a big mix of excitement and nervous-<<CRLF>>ness. Your stomach's in knots, your heart's<<CRLF>>pumping right out of your chest...
#00103FI...uh...I think Ozma is probably more<<CRLF>>concerned about his responsibilities.<<CRLF>>
#00201FHmph! What are you implying?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWhat'll happen to the Spardas while<<CRLF>>you're away? I thought you were the<<CRLF>>only one who could look after them?
#00300FThere is another in the village who can<<CRLF>>take care of their basic needs. That is all<<CRLF>>she can do, but it should be sufficient.
#00304FNormally, even that would be forbidden<<CRLF>>by the laws of my tribe, however...<<CRLF>>
#00103FIs it that girl you've been friends with<<CRLF>>since you were a kid?<<CRLF>>
#00203FOh, I see what's going on here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FWhy don't you just marry her? I mean,<<CRLF>>I don't know how things work here, but<<CRLF>>it'd solve your law problem, right?
#00310F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FOh-ho, now that's an interesting<<CRLF>>reaction!<<CRLF>>
#00305F*cough*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FAwww...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FR-right...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FGetting back to the matter at hand,<<CRLF>>leaving here and following the river to<<CRLF>>the north should lead us to the ruin.
#00300FI have marked where I believe it is<<CRLF>>located on your map, should you need<<CRLF>>to confirm its location.
#00100FAll right, Adol. You ready for this?<<CRLF>>Let's set off!<<CRLF>>
That Leo came here earlier and went off on<<CRLF>>one of the Spardas without permission.<<CRLF>>
They seem to be getting really close to the<<CRLF>>opposite shore. I hope they'll be okay...<<CRLF>>
#00112FGuess they're trying to get across to<<CRLF>>the Primeval Lands too, huh?<<CRLF>>
#00305FI told them it was impossible on a Sparda,<<CRLF>>but they simply would not listen to reason.<<CRLF>>
#00209FW-will they be all right out there?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FEh, they're a surprisingly tough bunch.<<CRLF>>I'm sure they'll be fine.<<CRLF>>
Oh, it's you two. Did you need something?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FOh, no, we came about your request on<<CRLF>>the board.<<CRLF>>
Ah, for a temporary shopkeeper?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... Well, you've been cleared of suspicion,<<CRLF>>so...sure, why not?<<CRLF>>
You interested in trying your hand at sales?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, it's you two. Have you changed your mind<<CRLF>>about the temporary shopkeeper request?<<CRLF>>
Accept
Decline
All right. I suppose I'll have to wait for<<CRLF>>someone else, then.<<CRLF>>
Well, if you need to buy anything, let me know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Excellent!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Okay, let me give you the run-down of what<<CRLF>>I'd like you to do.<<CRLF>>
You two look like real merchants standing there<<CRLF>>together!<<CRLF>>
Today, I want the two of you to be shop<<CRLF>>attendants. Basically, if a customer comes<<CRLF>>along, you sell them things. Simple, right?
There is one thing I need to explain, though,<<CRLF>>and that's how I process discounts.<<CRLF>>
#00109FDiscounts?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's the secret to making everyone happy...<<CRLF>>or the secret to staying in business, perhaps?<<CRLF>>Either way, discounts are extremely important.
Being a successful businessman isn't just about<<CRLF>>selling things at their standard price. You need<<CRLF>>to be able to adapt based on the situation.
I'm going to explain what you can and can't<<CRLF>>discount, so pay attention and don't forget<<CRLF>>any of this!
#00111F*sigh* This is sounding like it's gonna<<CRLF>>be a pain...<<CRLF>>
Haha. Now, now, don't be like that! This is the<<CRLF>>authentic salesman experience. Welcome to my<<CRLF>>world!
...Here we go! You listening?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
First, we have grains.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wheat, legumes, corn, those sorts of things.<<CRLF>>They're essential to most diets, but...<<CRLF>>
The harvest time for them has passed already,<<CRLF>>so we can't sell them at a discount right now.<<CRLF>>
#00100FDon't discount grains. Right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Next, fresh ingredients. Specifically, fruits<<CRLF>>and vegetables and such.<<CRLF>>
As far as vegetables go, the harvest was<<CRLF>>remarkably average this year, so we can't<<CRLF>>really lower their prices.
Most fruits and nuts, on the other hand, can<<CRLF>>still be harvested quite easily, so there's<<CRLF>>definitely some wiggle room on price.
In particular, we've harvested a lot of<<CRLF>>Chito Nuts today.<<CRLF>>
And if there are any left over, they'll just go<<CRLF>>to waste...so try to sell these at a discount as<<CRLF>>much as possible.
#00105FErr...don't discount vegetables, sell Chito<<CRLF>>Nuts at a discount as much as possible.<<CRLF>>Right.
In particular, we've harvested a lot of Raparo<<CRLF>>Fruits today.<<CRLF>>
And if there are any left over, they'll just go<<CRLF>>to waste...so try to sell these at a discount as<<CRLF>>much as possible.
#00105FErr...don't discount vegetables, sell Raparo<<CRLF>>Fruits at a discount as much as possible.<<CRLF>>Right.
In particular, we've harvested a lot of Arieda<<CRLF>>Fruits today.<<CRLF>>
And if there are any left over, they'll just go<<CRLF>>to waste...so try to sell these at a discount as<<CRLF>>much as possible.
#00105FErr...don't discount vegetables, sell Arieda<<CRLF>>Fruits at a discount as much as possible.<<CRLF>>Right.
Next we have the clothing fabrics. Silk and<<CRLF>>cotton and such.<<CRLF>>
We'll be harvesting some more raw cotton quite<<CRLF>>soon, and there's still a fair amount left over,<<CRLF>>so try and get rid of that cheaply if you can.
#00100FSell cotton at a discount. Right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Finally, there's dishware. Cups, plates, those<<CRLF>>kinds of daily essentials.<<CRLF>>
We can't offer any discounts on those at all,<<CRLF>>so definitely keep that in mind.<<CRLF>>
#00109FNo sales on dishware. Got it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...Whew, that was a lot to take in.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, and before I forget...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F*sigh* There's more?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Make sure to always greet customers with a<<CRLF>>cheery smile.<<CRLF>>
While no one suspects you any more, you're<<CRLF>>still not from this village.<<CRLF>>
So people will feel a lot more at ease with you<<CRLF>>if you look confident and...approachable.<<CRLF>>
#00100FHmm... Yeah, that does make sense.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That about wraps it up.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Do you think you can remember all that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I can explain everything again if you'd like.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've got it down pat!
Explain again, please.
All right. Listen closely this time, please.<<CRLF>>First, we have grains.<<CRLF>>
Wheat, legumes, corn, those sorts of things.<<CRLF>>They're essential to most diets, but...<<CRLF>>
The harvest time for them has passed already,<<CRLF>>so we can't sell them at a discount right now.<<CRLF>>

We can't offer any discounts on those at all,<<CRLF>>so definitely keep that in mind.<<CRLF>>
And finally, make sure to greet customers with<<CRLF>>a cheery smile. That's vital as well.<<CRLF>>
While no one suspects you any more, you're<<CRLF>>still not from this village.<<CRLF>>
So people will feel a lot more at ease with you<<CRLF>>if you look confident and approachable.<<CRLF>>
I think that's everything.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Got it all this time? I can explain it as many<<CRLF>>times as you need me to.<<CRLF>>
Excellent. Thank you very much.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAll right, let's get to work!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FIf I put my mind to it, I'm sure I can<<CRLF>>be one of the best businessmen around!<<CRLF>>
Er, well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm sorry to say this when you're all fired up,<<CRLF>>but...<<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thinking about it, one shopkeeper is all that's<<CRLF>>really needed.<<CRLF>>
So what I'd REALLY appreciate is someone big<<CRLF>>and strong to help me cart my supplies.<<CRLF>>
#00110FWhat? Why me?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FI went to all that trouble memorizing all<<CRLF>>the items I could discount, too!<<CRLF>>
Sorry to disappoint!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's just, lately, my back has been aching<<CRLF>>terribly.<<CRLF>>
Without your help, I...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102FFine, fine!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FI'll do it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FSorry, Adol, looks like I'll have to leave<<CRLF>>the shop to you.<<CRLF>>
#00111FHope you can manage on your own!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks. I'm really grateful for the help.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We'll have to leave right away.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So take good care of the shop while I'm gone,<<CRLF>>okay?<<CRLF>>
Oh, my, I wasn't expecting to find such a fine<<CRLF>>young man running the shop today!<<CRLF>>
...Though I think Ray would be upset if he<<CRLF>>heard me say that. Heh.<<CRLF>>
So I've actually come to look at different<<CRLF>>fabrics for my sewing.<<CRLF>>
Is there anything cheap today that you would<<CRLF>>recommend?<<CRLF>>
Recommend linen
Recommend cotton
Linen, you say? How much is that today?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... That doesn't really seem to be any<<CRLF>>cheaper than usual.<<CRLF>>
Well, I suppose I can wait a bit longer before<<CRLF>>buying anything.<<CRLF>>
Thanks for your help!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Cotton, you say? How much is that today?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, my, that is cheap!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, then, I think I'll take...oh, why not?<<CRLF>>Five bolts, if you'd please!<<CRLF>>
...Now that is a lot of cotton...but what<<CRLF>>a great deal! Thanks so much!<<CRLF>>
Shopping, shopping! Plate, plate, plate! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Umm...where are the plates?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ooh, there they are!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, umm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Can you shell this plate any cheaper?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Refuse
Sell at a discount

Slack off
What a spirited young man you are!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I have a hankering for...a fruit, or a nut.<<CRLF>>Just one. Whichever's cheapest.<<CRLF>>
Sell him a Chito Nut
Sell him a Raparo Fruit
Sell him an Arieda Fruit
Well, that is a lower price than usual!<<CRLF>>Very nice.<<CRLF>>
Hmm... That's regular price, it seems.<<CRLF>>Guess today's just not my lucky day!<<CRLF>>I'll take it anyway.
Keep up the good work, now!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol was wracked with intense guilt.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
La la laaa! <<|F481|>> Shopping is so much fun!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Okay, I need to stop looking and actually buy<<CRLF>>something.<<CRLF>>
Excuse me, sir?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Could I have...ummm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How about bread flour, tomatoes and Chito<<CRLF>>Nuts, please?<<CRLF>>

Oh, my, that's much cheaper than usual.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ah, I heard from our Rilche that you gave<<CRLF>>her a little bonus earlier.<<CRLF>>
I suppose I'll buy a little more than usual,<<CRLF>>as my way of saying thanks!<<CRLF>>
Here's the money.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks again!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thanks for that, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How did everything go?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FUgh, you look like you've been having a<<CRLF>>great time there.<<CRLF>>
#00101FI've been worked so hard, I thought I<<CRLF>>was gonna collapse!<<CRLF>>
Haha. I really do appreciate your help, Duren.<<CRLF>>That would've been so much harder without you.<<CRLF>>
Young people really do have so much more<<CRLF>>energy!<<CRLF>>
#00109FYoung people? ...How old are you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heh. Do you really want to know?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well...I'm not telling you! That information is<<CRLF>>s-e-c-r-e-t! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
#00105F(Can I punch him? Please let me punch<<CRLF>>him.)<<CRLF>>
At any rate...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Let me see how much you sold.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Wow, I hadn't expected you to do so well!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Have you ever considered becoming a merchant?<<CRLF>>I think you're a natural.<<CRLF>>
For your natural business sense, I give you<<CRLF>>this.<<CRLF>>

And for your effort, I give you this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

There haven't been any major incidents here<<CRLF>>since the mist on the other side of the river<<CRLF>>disappeared, but we can't let our guard down.
Especially when it comes to Romn. I'd really<<CRLF>>rather not have anything to do with them...<<CRLF>>
It's kind of strange how the Romun soldiers are<<CRLF>>all dressed the same.<<CRLF>>
It makes it...a bit difficult to tell them<<CRLF>>apart, quite honestly.<<CRLF>>
I think it's safe to assume the Romun soldiers<<CRLF>>who passed by the village have reached the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands by now.
I have mixed feelings about the fact that<<CRLF>>outsiders discovered the secrets of the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands before we could ourselves.
I wonder what could've happened to cause the<<CRLF>>river to calm and the mist to disappear?<<CRLF>>
I just hope it's not an omen of bad things to<<CRLF>>come...<<CRLF>>
To tell you the truth, I'm a bit nervous about<<CRLF>>Ozma's absence from the village, but we have to<<CRLF>>respect his decision.
And all of us here have a duty to protect one<<CRLF>>another, and protect our way of life, while he's<<CRLF>>away.
Thanks so much for your help today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm truly grateful for it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Now that we've found the culprit and can fish<<CRLF>>again, I suppose life here is back to normal.<<CRLF>>
...Guess I should get back to work.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Now that we can't fish due to the poison in the<<CRLF>>river, our only means of survival is to scavenge<<CRLF>>the forest for alternative food sources.
Compared to fishing, hunting and gathering in<<CRLF>>the forest is a most difficult task.<<CRLF>>
But in times like this, we need to pull together<<CRLF>>as a village and do what we can.<<CRLF>>
Syriu's always such a hard worker.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't think you'll find many girls who want<<CRLF>>to be blacksmiths, but that's what I love about<<CRLF>>her.
Syriu looks so great when she's working.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Working up a sweat in front of that forge...<<CRLF>>*gulp* Soooo sexy...<<CRLF>>
Looks like Syriu's hard at work again today.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...But that damned Hakan keeps getting in my<<CRLF>>way so I can't stare at her!<<CRLF>>
Hmm...<<CRLF>>Three days of eating nothing but Kuru Nuts...<<CRLF>>
I suppose I could do it...but is there any<<CRLF>>reason to?<<CRLF>>
...No, no no no, no chance! No chance!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm not even going to think about it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No, no no no, even if eating one didn't kill<<CRLF>>me -- and it very well might! -- I definitely<<CRLF>>wouldn't get off lightly.
I saw a beast eat one and it was writhing in<<CRLF>>agony afterward!<<CRLF>>
Don't try and find meaning in it, Reynal!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There isn't any!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* It sure is boring around here without<<CRLF>>Reynal.<<CRLF>>
I wish he'd hurry up and come back so I could<<CRLF>>tease him some more...<<CRLF>>
Oh, Reynal, my sweet Reynal...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How should I torment him today? There are so<<CRLF>>many possibilities...<<CRLF>>
There's really a steep cliff on the other side<<CRLF>>of the river, huh?<<CRLF>>
I think you should go climb it yourself to<<CRLF>>make sure it's real. Go on!<<CRLF>>
Oh, Reynal, my sweet Reynal...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hurry up and come back so I can tease you<<CRLF>>some more! It's so boring here without you!<<CRLF>>
I'm glad we can finally fish again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Although it's boring without Reynal.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if the fish that died from the poison<<CRLF>>are still edible...<<CRLF>>
Try one, Reynal. You might be okay!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* It's so boring when we can't go out and<<CRLF>>fish.<<CRLF>>
All you do is grumble about not being able to<<CRLF>>go fishing!<<CRLF>>
If you've got time to grumble, spend it sorting<<CRLF>>out what I'm going to eat instead!<<CRLF>>
I would if I could, but what am I supposed to<<CRLF>>do?<<CRLF>>
#00109FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FHow long's it been since the poison first<<CRLF>>appeared in the river, anyway?<<CRLF>>
Oh, it's you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I see you're investigating the poisoning with<<CRLF>>Ozma.<<CRLF>>
Well, go on, Reynal. Answer the question!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
R-right...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The poison first appeared in the river about...<<CRLF>>ten days ago, I think.<<CRLF>>
#00101FHmm... Ten days? Quite a while ago,<<CRLF>>then.<<CRLF>>
...Is that all you have to say?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wh-what?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* You're missing the most important<<CRLF>>detail.<<CRLF>>
It happened immediately after this redheaded<<CRLF>>swordsman here left the village!<<CRLF>>
B-but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FR-really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And he disappeared without telling anyone where<<CRLF>>he was going, or even telling anyone that he was<<CRLF>>leaving!
How could we not suspect him? There's a<<CRLF>>mountain of evidence implicating him in this!<<CRLF>>
#00105FGotta admit, I see your point.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FStill, the evidence against Adol is purely<<CRLF>>circumstantial. We cannot prove his guilt<<CRLF>>any more than his innocence.
#00300FWe must continue our investigation.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The Primeval Lands... Romn... Comodo...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
When I grow up I kinda want to go see the<<CRLF>>world instead of being a fisherman.<<CRLF>>
Those guys over there say they're Romun<<CRLF>>soldiers.<<CRLF>>
How're soldiers different from fishermen? Do<<CRLF>>they catch something other than fish to eat?<<CRLF>>
Ducky, ducky, ducky! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The way ducks wave their butts from side to<<CRLF>>side as they walk is really cute!<<CRLF>>
I wonder what that huge pillar-y thing on the<<CRLF>>other side of the river is...?<<CRLF>>
Do people live in it? That'd be so neat!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ducky, ducky, ducky! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ducks really get on well with their parents.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Seems like you didn't do anything wrong after<<CRLF>>all.<<CRLF>>
...I'm sorry for thinking you were a baddie.<<CRLF>>Come and play again sometime, okay?<<CRLF>>
Oh, Ado-- I mean, g-get lost, poisoner!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm not gonna help a baddie like you. Go away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Why are pikkards so cute?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Is it some kind of self-preservation mechanism?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder what those soldiers are here for...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
They're not after the pikkards, are they?<<CRLF>>No, that would just be silly...<<CRLF>>
I wonder if there are any pikkards in the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands.<<CRLF>>
...I'd like to go and see them if there are!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've never seen the other side of the river this<<CRLF>>clearly in my whole life.<<CRLF>>
I wonder what happened. I might be imagining<<CRLF>>it, but the pikkards seem restless ever since<<CRLF>>the weather cleared up over there, too...
Pikkards might look the same from one to the<<CRLF>>next, but they all have little quirks that make<<CRLF>>them unique.
Heh. I wonder if pikkards have love lives...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's so lovely to be able to fish again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heh. Maybe it's just me, but these pikkards<<CRLF>>seem happier now too!<<CRLF>>
If we can't get any fish to eat, then I'll...<<CRLF>>I'll have to...<<CRLF>>
...No! What am I thinking?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Aww... It's so boring around here without Gazock.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Where did he go, anyway?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Those people in armor said they came from<<CRLF>>Romn.<<CRLF>>
...I wonder what kind of village Romn is?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if Gazock went across the river to<<CRLF>>those Primeval Lands people keep talking<<CRLF>>about.
What if he doesn't come back?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Gazock hasn't come back here for ages.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if he went back to his house in the<<CRLF>>forest...<<CRLF>>
Where did Gazock go?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if he went back into the forest...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We can eat as many fish as we want again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheheh. I can't wait for dinner!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Gazock said he used to live in the forest all on<<CRLF>>his own.<<CRLF>>

It must be easy to be a fish. All you have to<<CRLF>>do is swim around lazily all day!<<CRLF>>
...Although I suppose they're as desperate<<CRLF>>to survive as us humans, so they're really<<CRLF>>not that different from us where it counts.
The environment around the river's<<CRLF>>changed dramatically lately.<<CRLF>>
I stopped fishing early to survey the area.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I just hope nothing else happens here...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I just hope nothing else happens here...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* I'm getting a headache.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The poison didn't make it this far down<<CRLF>>the river.<<CRLF>>
As a result, the village's drinking water is<<CRLF>>safe for the time being, but I can't say with<<CRLF>>confidence that it will remain that way.
If poison were to reach our drinking water,<<CRLF>>this village really would be finished.<<CRLF>>
If you really aren't the culprit, hurry<<CRLF>>up and catch the real one. Please.<<CRLF>>

Much has happened of late. My mind is in<<CRLF>>complete disarray.<<CRLF>>
But, I mustn't complain. I will persevere!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Unusually fresh winds from the exotic lands...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But winds can become storms...and this, I fear.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The Primeval Lands. A region of great mystery,<<CRLF>>untouched by those of us who don't belong for<<CRLF>>hundreds of years.
The path may be open...but I do not seek to<<CRLF>>walk it.<<CRLF>>
The Primeval Lands can be seen so clearly.<<CRLF>>My surprise is great.<<CRLF>>
The cause of this change, still unknown...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The men of the village are fishing today,<<CRLF>>to provide food for all.<<CRLF>>
The women of the village await their return,<<CRLF>>tending the children.<<CRLF>>
The deeds of the large man who poisoned the<<CRLF>>river, unforgivable...<<CRLF>>
His reasoning for such an act, unfathomable...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The river dyed crimson, a horrifying sight...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FThe river dyed crimson? I take it you're<<CRLF>>not talking about the setting sun or any-<<CRLF>>thing like that, are you?
The color of blood is the color of death.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yet no one was hurt, our only salvation...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FSo that means the poison was red...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FCan't imagine how much you'd need to<<CRLF>>dye a whole river, though!<<CRLF>>
It lasted mere moments, but the river was<<CRLF>>stained red as far as the eye could see.<<CRLF>>
The source was upstream. All that remained<<CRLF>>were the corpses of the fish.<<CRLF>>
We know not when the river will be pure once<<CRLF>>again. Thus, the men cannot fish.<<CRLF>>
#00105FThat does sound pretty tough.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWere the fishermen okay? The ones who<<CRLF>>were out on the water when the poison<<CRLF>>first showed up?
#00305FFortunately, they noticed quickly. There<<CRLF>>were no casualties.<<CRLF>>
#00300FSeveral fishermen who had come into<<CRLF>>contact with the substance did fall ill...<<CRLF>>
#00300FBut all of them have made a full<<CRLF>>recovery since.<<CRLF>>
Our only salvation. The Spardas were uninjured,<<CRLF>>too.<<CRLF>>
#00101FHmm... A large amount of poison coming<<CRLF>>from upstream...<<CRLF>>
#00101FWe might be dealing with a bigger disaster<<CRLF>>than I thought.<<CRLF>>
The color of blood is the color of death.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yet no one was hurt, our only salvation...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Now that the river current has slowed, fishing<<CRLF>>has become much easier.<<CRLF>>
But if I'm to be honest, I actually feel it's a<<CRLF>>little too easy now. I miss the faster current.<<CRLF>>
It was about daybreak, I think... All of a<<CRLF>>sudden, the mist over the river just...vanished!<<CRLF>>
That mist was supposed to have hung there for<<CRLF>>hundreds of years, so to have it vanish in a<<CRLF>>mere instant is...unsettling.
I saw it happen with my own eyes, yet I still<<CRLF>>find it hard to believe.<<CRLF>>

I saw it happen with my own eyes, yet I still<<CRLF>>find it hard to believe.<<CRLF>>
...Sure enough, they were washed down the<<CRLF>>river.<<CRLF>>
Well, that's what they get for trying to ride<<CRLF>>one of the Spardas without permission. Not<<CRLF>>my fault!
Take care, Ozma. The forest is filled with all<<CRLF>>kinds of dangers.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure I don't need to warn you of the beasts'<<CRLF>>ferocity, but I'd recommend you not take your<<CRLF>>eyes off the redhead either.
Ozma, you're wasting your time if you think<<CRLF>>they're going to be able to prove their innocence.<<CRLF>>
That redhead there is the culprit. Nothing will<<CRLF>>change that.<<CRLF>>
#00300FDo you have any evidence to back that<<CRLF>>claim, Rivarl?<<CRLF>>
Of course! The poison came from upstream,<<CRLF>>right?<<CRLF>>
And upstream is the dwelling of the Spardas.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOh, so the sacred beasts live upstream?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...But how does that prove Adol's the<<CRLF>>culprit?<<CRLF>>
Because no one from this village would dare<<CRLF>>go upstream and approach the sacred beasts'<<CRLF>>dwelling.
Not unless they were one of Ozma's tribesmen,<<CRLF>>anyway. But there's only one of those left, and<<CRLF>>it's Ozma himself!
So the only one who could have gone upstream<<CRLF>>to poison the river from there would be an<<CRLF>>outsider. And those are in pretty short supply.
Is that all you've got on me?
Ozma could be the culprit too.
Hmph. Of course you're playing innocent. It's<<CRLF>>pretty much all you've got left.<<CRLF>>
Naturally, there's plenty more evidence than<<CRLF>>just that.<<CRLF>>
You've got to be kidding. There's no way Ozma<<CRLF>>could be the culprit! What a ridiculous thing to<<CRLF>>say! The very notion is...offensive!
#00305FIf you objectively analyze the evidence we<<CRLF>>have gathered, however, it is a perfectly<<CRLF>>valid theory.
#00300FNaturally, I was not responsible, but nor<<CRLF>>could I provide enough evidence to con-<<CRLF>>vince an impartial judge of my innocence.
W-well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
D-don't worry, Ozma, I have other evidence that<<CRLF>>suggests he's the culprit!<<CRLF>>
You were asking about the sacred beasts'<<CRLF>>dwelling, you know!<<CRLF>>
#00111F...Yeah, he's like that. If there's something<<CRLF>>new and exciting to explore, he wants to<<CRLF>>explore it. It's in his nature.
Hmph. Say what you want, he still did it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Don't you have any shame at all? You could<<CRLF>>spare yourself a lot of embarrassment if you'd<<CRLF>>just confess.
I've said all I have to say. I don't want to<<CRLF>>talk to you any longer.<<CRLF>>
Go away, and never return!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FMan, Adol, you really don't seem to be<<CRLF>>popular around here.<<CRLF>>
#00111FGuess you do stick your nose in<<CRLF>>everybody's business, though, so it's<<CRLF>>not really any surprise!
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Enough! I told you, I don't want to<<CRLF>>discuss this with you anymore!<<CRLF>>
Go away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

We regret that it may be possible the people of<<CRLF>>this village will experience some inconvenience,<<CRLF>>as with the people of Comodo, but we'd ask...
*sigh* It's tough being a messenger.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've had enough of exploring this damned forest<<CRLF>>to last me a lifetime!<<CRLF>>
It appears those soldiers have decided to come<<CRLF>>here as well.<<CRLF>>
Nothing they're saying is unreasonable, but<<CRLF>>I still don't know if we can really trust<<CRLF>>them...
#00100FWhere are you going? We need to search<<CRLF>>for clues on who poisoned the river.<<CRLF>>
#00300FI have instructed the villagers to cooperate<<CRLF>>with our investigation. We should listen to<<CRLF>>what they have to say.
Meeheehee! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Meeeeheeee!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp3201m.JSON_TEXT 2 >>
#00300FDid you not want to see the Spardas?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThey are kept in the western building.<<CRLF>>Let us go before it gets dark.<<CRLF>>
<< mp3202.JSON_TEXT 1017 >>
#00102F#16SHow many times do I have to tell<<CRLF>>you, he doesn't remember anything!<<CRLF>>
...Can you prove that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FWell, no, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Then this conversation is over.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're gonna get me in trouble if you keep<<CRLF>>yammering on, so stay in there and shut up!<<CRLF>>
#00112FCome on, Adol! This is your doing,<<CRLF>>apparently!<<CRLF>>
#00112FSay something, dammit!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What did I do, exactly?
Don't you know who I am?!
...S-stop playing innocent!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No one from this village would do such a thing,<<CRLF>>so it has to be you!<<CRLF>>
#00109F...'Such a thing' being?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, I know you're the first person to come<<CRLF>>here through the forest.<<CRLF>>
But to think you'd repay us for welcoming you<<CRLF>>by doing something so heinous...<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat is he being accused of? What are<<CRLF>>you so sure Adol did?!<<CRLF>>
Don't play dumb! You know exactly what you<<CRLF>>did! You poisoned the river!<<CRLF>>
#00110FWhat the...?! That's terrible!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And not just once, but many times over, each<<CRLF>>time killing more and more fish!<<CRLF>>
#00104F...I see. Naturally, Adol is the number one<<CRLF>>suspect, being the only outsider you've<<CRLF>>seen...ever, I guess?
#00111F*sigh* This is just like what happened in<<CRLF>>Comodo...<<CRLF>>
#00111FSo did anyone actually witness Adol<<CRLF>>poisoning the water?<<CRLF>>
#00101FI think I get where you're coming from.<<CRLF>>Especially if Adol is the only outsider<<CRLF>>you've ever had visit your village before.
#00101FBut did anyone actually see him poison<<CRLF>>the water?<<CRLF>>
This whole village's survival depends on our<<CRLF>>ability to fish.<<CRLF>>
Everyone here knows that! So why would any<<CRLF>>of us ever do such a horrible thing?!<<CRLF>>
#00100FOkay, okay, calm down! Sheesh!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou checked the whole area thoroughly,<<CRLF>>right?<<CRLF>>
Of course we did! We went out on the Spardas<<CRLF>>and searched every last bend.<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat's a Sparda?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
They're the sacred beasts that we raise in this<<CRLF>>village. We can't fish without them.<<CRLF>>
...But enough with the chatter! For the last<<CRLF>>time, be quiet! I don't have to explain any of<<CRLF>>this to you!
Until we've figured out what to do with you,<<CRLF>>you will remain here, and you will remain<<CRLF>>silent!
#00104FSacred beasts, huh? Hmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FYou remember anything about them,<<CRLF>>Adol?<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol had a slight headache and was feeling mildly dizzy.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol's base DEF increased by 1.
#00100F...So you met some guy called Ozma<<CRLF>>here? Hmm...<<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, you really don't seem like the river-<<CRLF>>poisoning type to me...<<CRLF>>
#00105FBut it's totally possible you let yourself<<CRLF>>get dragged into something and wound up<<CRLF>>unwittingly taking part in this mess.
#00100FEither way, it looks like we need to meet<<CRLF>>this Ozma person and see what he has to<<CRLF>>say.
#4CAdol knocked on the door.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Again? What is it THIS time?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm hungry.
I want to see Ozma.
Y-you can't be serious...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We don't even have enough food for the<<CRLF>>villagers right now, seeing as we can't go<<CRLF>>out and fish.
So you're just going to have to deal with it.<<CRLF>>Frankly, it serves you right!<<CRLF>>
A-are you for real? Do you honestly not<<CRLF>>understand your position right now?!<<CRLF>>
Ozma's in the middle of a meeting wherein he<<CRLF>>will determine what's to be done with you.<<CRLF>>
And even if that weren't the case, he's an<<CRLF>>essential figure in our village...a brilliant<<CRLF>>leader, particularly considering his age.
We would never allow him to meet with the<<CRLF>>likes of you!<<CRLF>>
...Wh-what?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What are you...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...That's really not a good idea!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat's happening out there?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...We meet again, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FI have been informed of the situation.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo you were worried about Adol and<<CRLF>>came to see him, huh?<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat'd be an awful big help right now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FSo you're going to convince everyone that<<CRLF>>Adol here doesn't remember anything and<<CRLF>>didn't do anything wrong, right?
#00305F...Adol, is this man your friend?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He's a great friend.
He's a total stranger.
#00305FReally? You ought to choose your friends<<CRLF>>more carefully, then.<<CRLF>>
#00305FI see. I suspected you would not choose<<CRLF>>your friends so poorly.<<CRLF>>
#00111FHey! What the hell, man?! I'm right here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FYou said your name was Duren? You<<CRLF>>need to think your position through a<<CRLF>>bit more carefully.
#00300FLet us assume that Adol did indeed lose<<CRLF>>his memories. How does that fact prove<<CRLF>>his innocence in this matter?
#00300FSuch reasoning will not persuade a soul.<<CRLF>>Certainly not mine.<<CRLF>>
#00111FW-well, yeah, I can't really argue with<<CRLF>>that...<<CRLF>>
#00104FDoes that mean you suspect Adol too?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FI still am uncertain what to believe, so I<<CRLF>>came to speak with Adol directly.<<CRLF>>
#00300FAdol, I have a proposal for you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIf you are truly innocent of this crime,<<CRLF>>that would mean the real culprit must<<CRLF>>still be out there.
#00300FIf you can find the real culprit, then and<<CRLF>>only then will I trust your innocence. Will<<CRLF>>you agree to this arrangement?
I will.
How do I go about doing that?
#00300FVery well. There is no time to waste,<<CRLF>>then. I will tell the villagers to cooperate<<CRLF>>with your investigation.
#00109FInvestigation? What're we supposed to do,<<CRLF>>exactly?<<CRLF>>
#00305FThat is entirely up to you, but I will<<CRLF>>cooperate as best as I can.<<CRLF>>
#00111FWell, we can't do much sleuthing when<<CRLF>>we're locked up in here...<<CRLF>>
#00300FNaturally, you will be allowed to walk<<CRLF>>around the village. I will be accompany<<CRLF>>you to supervise your actions.
#00300FThat way, you will be able to conduct your<<CRLF>>investigation without worrying the villagers.<<CRLF>>
#00100FHey! Works for me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FBut are you sure it's all right to lead<<CRLF>>around suspected criminals when you're<<CRLF>>the guy in charge?
#00104FPeople might think you're on our side or<<CRLF>>something...<<CRLF>>
#00305FI do not take sides.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FProving a suspect's innocence or guilt is<<CRLF>>one of my duties as village leader, and the<<CRLF>>first step toward ending this.
#00300FI do what is best for Selray.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI can see why they look up to you here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you, Ozma.
I swear I'll prove my innocence.
#00304FTh-think nothing of it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FGood. We must do something to resolve<<CRLF>>this situation. Anything...<<CRLF>>
#00100FRight. So, can you remind us where<<CRLF>>we're going?<<CRLF>>
#00300FAs you wish.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThe wild Sparda breeding ground is sit-<<CRLF>>uated south of Selray.<<CRLF>>
#00300FOn that drawing you call a 'map,' it<<CRLF>>would be about...<<CRLF>>
#00300FHere, I believe.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FHmm... So as long as we follow the river<<CRLF>>south, we'll be there in no time.<<CRLF>>
#00100FDoesn't seem too far from here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIndeed. The entrance is situated near<<CRLF>>a waterfall basin. It is difficult to miss.<<CRLF>>
#00300FI have told the villagers that we are<<CRLF>>continuing the investigation.<<CRLF>>
#00300FMake sure you are properly equipped for<<CRLF>>the perils that await before leaving the<<CRLF>>village.
#00100FAll right, then, let's do this!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4COzma joined the party.
#00100FWell, I think we've managed to prove<<CRLF>>that Adol's not the culprit...<<CRLF>>
#00111FBut what are you going to do now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FI will tell the villagers about the man we<<CRLF>>met.<<CRLF>>
#00305FPeople will be shocked, but without a<<CRLF>>culprit, the people of Selray will be unable<<CRLF>>to move on.
#00304FAs for the secret of the Spardas...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You should tell everyone.
You don't need to say a thing.
#00304FYou are most likely correct, but I still do<<CRLF>>not feel ready to take such action. I am<<CRLF>>truly sorry.
#00304FThank you for the assurance. But I still<<CRLF>>am undecided on how best to proceed.<<CRLF>>
#00304F...I wish I could deny it, but what that<<CRLF>>man said is not entirely incorrect.<<CRLF>>
#00304FMuch as it shames me to admit it...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOzma...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FBut I feel my tribe...my mother and my<<CRLF>>father were responsible for protecting<<CRLF>>something important.
#00300FSomething more important entirely than<<CRLF>>the simple secret of Sparda husbandry.<<CRLF>>
#00300FHowever, I have no idea what that know-<<CRLF>>ledge may have been. Their deaths came<<CRLF>>far too suddenly...
#00300FI learned to care for the Spardas from<<CRLF>>notes they left behind, and that alone<<CRLF>>was all of what they had written.
#00109FSo you think they would've told you<<CRLF>>something else if they'd survived?<<CRLF>>
#00100FWhat makes you think that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...My instincts tell me this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI believe the Spardas carry an important<<CRLF>>secret. Something more important than the<<CRLF>>laws mention, concerning their nature.
Their nature?
You sure you're not overthinking things?
#00300FI cannot deny the importance of the laws<<CRLF>>concerning them. But I know in my heart<<CRLF>>that there is still more to be learned.
#00300FAdol, does it not seem odd to you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FCan you see any reason for the Spardas<<CRLF>>to be called sacred beasts?<<CRLF>>
#00109FHuh? ...What do you mean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FNormally, when rearing beasts and live-<<CRLF>>stock, the community shares in that work...<<CRLF>>and in its potential dangers as well.
#00305FBut the Spardas are different. They have<<CRLF>>been labeled as 'sacred beasts,' and<<CRLF>>everything about them is a mystery.
#00300FCould it be that by establishing this label,<<CRLF>>my ancestors were actually trying to hide<<CRLF>>something?
#00109FNow that you mention it...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FI believe that my parents and my<<CRLF>>ancestors knew the true secret and<<CRLF>>worked to protect it.
#00105FHuh. I can definitely see where you're<<CRLF>>coming from...<<CRLF>>
#00300FIt was not so much anger that I felt<<CRLF>>toward that man...<<CRLF>>
#00300FI was more frustrated with myself for<<CRLF>>noticing the existence of a hidden truth, yet<<CRLF>>being unable to discover it all this time.
#00100FWell, but that's not your fault, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FAnd I don't think anyone would blame<<CRLF>>you for wanting to beat the crap out of<<CRLF>>a guy like that.
#00305FThat is a rather...blunt way to put it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FEither way, I have much to think about<<CRLF>>going forward, both regarding myself and<<CRLF>>Selray...
I'd be happy to help.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
#00301FI appreciate the sentiment, Adol, but you<<CRLF>>should focus on getting your memories<<CRLF>>back first and foremost.
#00111FSeriously. Adol just can't resist taking<<CRLF>>every chance he gets to help every living<<CRLF>>soul with every problem they've got!
#00301F...Hearing that from someone who has<<CRLF>>made it this far through the Great Forest<<CRLF>>makes it all the more convincing to me.
#00111FAdol, you need to worry about getting<<CRLF>>your own memories back before you go<<CRLF>>assuring other people that they'll be fine.
#00303FHaha...hahahahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FAdol, Duren, I am truly grateful for<<CRLF>>everything you have done.<<CRLF>>
#00301FIf you should find yourself in the area<<CRLF>>again, please know that you will always<<CRLF>>be welcome here.
#00103FThanks. We'll drop by again for sure if<<CRLF>>we're ever in the neighborhood!<<CRLF>>
#00209FOoh, so this is Ozma's house?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah. He's really young, yet he's the<<CRLF>>village leader. Really serious guy.<<CRLF>>
#00309F...Is that you, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI am pleased to see you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MActually, there is something I wish to discuss<<CRLF>>with you...<<CRLF>>
What a coincidence.
What do you want to discuss?
#00300F...Oh, you had something to discuss with<<CRLF>>me as well? Please, makes yourselves<<CRLF>>comfortable.
#00300FIt is a matter that has been on my mind<<CRLF>>for quite some time.<<CRLF>>
#00309F...So you have found a way to cross over<<CRLF>>into the Primeval Lands, then?<<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah, apparently Adol managed to make<<CRLF>>it over there once already, before he lost<<CRLF>>his memories.
#00100FAt least, that looks to be the case. Can't<<CRLF>>say anything for sure until we've been over<<CRLF>>there ourselves.
#00100FBut in order to make it across the river,<<CRLF>>we'll need to find the entrance to the ruin<<CRLF>>mentioned in his old notebook.
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What's wrong?
Do you know where the entrance is?
#00304FNothing at all. My apologies.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FSadly, I do not.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...Adol, I have had something on my mind<<CRLF>>ever since I last saw you.<<CRLF>>
#00300FAs you know, I was never told the real<<CRLF>>secret of the Spardas.<<CRLF>>
#00109FYou mean the reason they're treated as<<CRLF>>sacred beasts?<<CRLF>>
#00300FIndeed.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FYet despite never being told, I feel it<<CRLF>>is my duty, and perhaps my destiny, to<<CRLF>>know the answer.
#00305FMy family is no longer with us, however,<<CRLF>>so it is conceivable I may never be able<<CRLF>>to learn the truth.
#00304FStill...I desire to know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FI wish to unearth the secret my mother<<CRLF>>and father protected for so long.<<CRLF>>
#00109FOzma...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThe sacred beasts are said to have come<<CRLF>>from the Primeval Lands, as I previously<<CRLF>>noted.
#00300FNaturally, there is no guarantee I will find<<CRLF>>the answers I seek there.<<CRLF>>
#00300FAnd I do apologize for making such a<<CRLF>>selfish request, but...I must go to the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands, no matter the risks.
#00109FSo with no one to tell you the answers,<<CRLF>>you want to go on a journey and find<<CRLF>>them yourself, huh?
#00200FI don't know the whole story here, but<<CRLF>>I definitely understand exactly how you feel.<<CRLF>>
#00200FIt's like, if you just stay in your village<<CRLF>>and pass up this chance, you know you'll<<CRLF>>end up regretting it later.
#00200FSo if this journey is what you want to do,<<CRLF>>you should do it. You don't want to have<<CRLF>>to always wonder what might've been.
#00203FRight, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Karna's right.
We'd be happy to have you with us.
#00100FYeah, that's actually really sound advice.<<CRLF>>Better to have tried and failed than never<<CRLF>>to have tried at all!
#00111F...Though in Adol's case, I seriously think<<CRLF>>he's motivated solely by curiosity for the<<CRLF>>unknown.
#00111FIt's hard to believe he's even a real person!<<CRLF>>Or at least, a real person older than five or<<CRLF>>so...
#00203FHahaha, that's so true!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI almost feel guilty for hoping you would<<CRLF>>say such a thing.<<CRLF>>
#00301FStill, thank you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FJust give it your all, and if it doesn't<<CRLF>>work out, it doesn't work out.<<CRLF>>
#00200FAnd even then, there's always something<<CRLF>>to learn from every failure. So chin up!<<CRLF>>This'll be a good journey.
#00203FI'm happy to have you with us, Ozma!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FAnd I you, Karna.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAnd so Ozma explained to the people of Selray, with some<<CRLF>>difficulty, that he was departing on a journey.<<CRLF>>
#4CThey seemed hesitant to accept this at first, but soon realized<<CRLF>>that they had depended on him for far too long, and wished him<<CRLF>>well.
Hey, Ozma.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Do you need something?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWe have come to discuss your request.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, you're here to help me out with that?<<CRLF>>That's great!<<CRLF>>
#00300FWould you be willing to assist her, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, did you change your mind? Well, come on<<CRLF>>back anytime. I'm ready whenever you are!<<CRLF>>
Accept
Decline
Aww, really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh well. I'm always here if you change your<<CRLF>>mind!<<CRLF>>
Really? Thanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo what do you want us to do?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FIt was something about testing a weapon,<<CRLF>>right?<<CRLF>>
That's the one! And not just any weapon...<<CRLF>>a SUPER weapon!<<CRLF>>
That's the important part!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FO-okay...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Aaaaat any rate...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
As you can see, I'm currently a blacksmith's<<CRLF>>apprentice.<<CRLF>>
So as part of my training, I decided to forge<<CRLF>>some completely new types of weapons.<<CRLF>>
#00300FAnd you would like us to test those<<CRLF>>weapons in a combat situation?<<CRLF>>
Well, at least one of them, yeah.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There is one detail I should proooobably<<CRLF>>mention, though...<<CRLF>>
These weapons need a little more...'refinement'<<CRLF>>before they're complete.<<CRLF>>
That's why I need them tested in actual battle,<<CRLF>>with real monsters. They have to be put through<<CRLF>>their paces, to work out all the kinks.
In their current states, both weapons are a<<CRLF>>little...unreliable. Don't say I didn't warn you!<<CRLF>>
#00105FThis is sounding pretty sketchy now...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ehh, you'll be fine! I have two weapons,<<CRLF>>and I'd be thrilled if you'd test out one<<CRLF>>of them on the field.
There's a sword and a gauntlet. Which would<<CRLF>>you prefer?<<CRLF>>
#00309FIs it all right to test only one? Would it<<CRLF>>not be better for us to take both?<<CRLF>>
Nah, I've made my mind up to focus all of my<<CRLF>>energy into one or the other. Basically, which-<<CRLF>>ever sounds more appealing to potential clients.
I'd rather make one 'amazing' weapon than two<<CRLF>>'great' ones, you know?<<CRLF>>
So! What'll it be? A spectacular sword, or a<<CRLF>>superb gauntlet?<<CRLF>>
Make your choice. Your path is...incandescent!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FWell, I'm not bothered either way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FIt's up to you, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Choose the sword
Choose the gauntlet
All right, here you go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks better than I expected.
It looks and sounds awesome!
Doesn't it?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16S...Wait, what were you expecting? Are you<<CRLF>>suggesting my description of it DIDN'T send<<CRLF>>shivers down your spine?!
Honestly, it's bad enough that<<CRLF>>bal*cough*die*cough* over there...<<CRLF>>
Er, I mean, it's bad enough my esteemed master<<CRLF>>doesn't appreciate my amazing naming sense.<<CRLF>>I'd expect more open-mindedness from you!
#00111F(Well, that escalated quickly...)<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16SI know, right?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I knew you'd appreciate my greatness!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And just for that, you can have this, too!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Okay, as for what I want you to actually do...<<CRLF>>Hmmmm...<<CRLF>>
How about equipping this weapon and defeating<<CRLF>>five 'Rangoas'?<<CRLF>>
Can't remember where to find them, exactly,<<CRLF>>but I'm sure you can figure it out. Once you've<<CRLF>>taken down five of them, let me know, 'kay?
Good luck!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, looks like you finished the test!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So how did you like my weapon? Wasn't it...<<CRLF>>sizzling?<<CRLF>>
It was hot stuff.
Magnifique.
#00111F...I can't believe you can say that with a<<CRLF>>straight face.<<CRLF>>
Haha. Must've given you quite the warm<<CRLF>>welcome, huh?<<CRLF>>
As you probably figured out, it's barely usable<<CRLF>>as-is.<<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now, though,<<CRLF>>based on your report. Hang on just a sec, okay?<<CRLF>>
#00111F...I can't believe you can say that with a<<CRLF>>straight face.<<CRLF>>
Haha. You're one special guy if that took your<<CRLF>>fancy!<<CRLF>>
As you probably figured out, it's barely usable<<CRLF>>as-is.<<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now, though,<<CRLF>>based on your report. Hang on just a sec, okay?<<CRLF>>
It hurt so good...
Magnifique.
#00105F...It really did hurt, you know! Like,<<CRLF>>a lot!<<CRLF>>
Haha. Sorry about that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now, though,<<CRLF>>based on your report. Hang on just a sec, okay?<<CRLF>>
#00101FOh sure, it's all right for you...<<CRLF>>You didn't have to use it!<<CRLF>>
Haha. Sorry about that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now, though,<<CRLF>>based on your report. Hang on just a sec, okay?<<CRLF>>
All right, it's done!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I name it the Amazing Incredible Deadly<<CRLF>>Destructive--<<CRLF>>
Syriu! Stop messin' around in front o'<<CRLF>>customers!<<CRLF>>
You're callin' it the Flame Sword, and tha's<<CRLF>>final.<<CRLF>>
You're callin' it the Venom Knuckle, and tha's<<CRLF>>final.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* No one gives weapons boring names like<<CRLF>>that these days, you know. You've got to--<<CRLF>>
H-hey! What're you using his name for?!<<CRLF>>He wasn't the one who forged it! This is<<CRLF>>my work, dammit!
It's an injustice! I don't authorize the use of<<CRLF>>that name! It's not even my work without my<<CRLF>>amazing naming sense! Are you even listening?!

Hey there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've made a couple more amazing weapons I<<CRLF>>need help testing. You feel like lending me a<<CRLF>>hand?
Oh, did you change your mind? Well, come on<<CRLF>>back anytime. I'm ready whenever you are!<<CRLF>>
Accept
Decline
Aww, really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh well. I'm always here if you change your<<CRLF>>mind!<<CRLF>>
Really? Thanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FAfter hearing Duren talk about what<<CRLF>>happened last time, I have to admit<<CRLF>>I'm kinda nervous.
#00200FYou're not going to ask us to test<<CRLF>>something harmful to our well-being<<CRLF>>again, are you?
What? Of course not! It's a hyper weapon!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...I have a bad feeling about this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. I'll let you see for yourselves.<<CRLF>>I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise!<<CRLF>>
You've done this before, so I don't think I need<<CRLF>>to explain much more.<<CRLF>>
The two weapons I have for you this time are<<CRLF>>an amazing knife or a perilous spear.<<CRLF>>
Which would you rather test?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304F...Perilous?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205FSounds like someone's going to suffer<<CRLF>>either way...<<CRLF>>
#00200FYou can choose, Adol. I promise we<<CRLF>>won't hate you for it.<<CRLF>>
Choose the knife
Choose the spear
All right, here you go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Same principle as last time. Equip it and defeat<<CRLF>>a set number of beasts with it.<<CRLF>>
This time I want the lucky subject to defeat<<CRLF>>five 'Crocles.'<<CRLF>>
I can't remember where to find them, so I'll<<CRLF>>leave that part up to you. Just make sure you<<CRLF>>take down five of them!
And best of luck to you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, looks like you finished the test!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So what did you think? Wasn't it amazing?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It was heavy stuff.
It was superb.
#00201F...You're enjoying this, aren't you,<<CRLF>>Adol?<<CRLF>>
Haha. That sounds about right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now. Hang on<<CRLF>>a sec.<<CRLF>>
#00205F...What part of that knife was 'superb?'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. Maybe I shouldn't have asked!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now. Hang on<<CRLF>>a sec.<<CRLF>>
It was shocking.
It was superb.
#00305F...It certainly was.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. Sounds like it caused even more trouble<<CRLF>>than I thought it might!<<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now. Hang on<<CRLF>>a sec.<<CRLF>>
#00305FI...cannot comprehend why you would<<CRLF>>say that unless you recently suffered<<CRLF>>some massive head trauma.
Haha. Maybe I shouldn't have asked!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now. Hang on<<CRLF>>a sec.<<CRLF>>
There, it's done!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I name it the Incredible Glorious Stunning--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Syriu, give it up already!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're callin' it the Spider Edge, and tha's<<CRLF>>final.<<CRLF>>
You're callin' it the Lightning Spear, and<<CRLF>>tha's final.<<CRLF>>
Hey, old man, don't interrupt me when I'm in<<CRLF>>the middle of--<<CRLF>>
W-wait a second, are you seriously going with<<CRLF>>that? That's not my name! How can you let him<<CRLF>>override me?! He has nothing to do with this!
Well, I don't even want to be associated with it<<CRLF>>anymore, if that's how you're going to treat me!<<CRLF>>Henceforth, that's an Alan Smithee work!

Hey there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've made a couple of really mind-blowing new<<CRLF>>weapons I need testing. Fancy lending me a<<CRLF>>hand?
Oh, did you change your mind? Well, come on<<CRLF>>back anytime. I'm ready whenever you are!<<CRLF>>
Accept

Aww, really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Really? Thanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00405F*sigh* I suppose it's our turn now...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. I've heard the weapons here are<<CRLF>>quite...noteworthy.<<CRLF>>
Excellent! I'm honored to hear it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
'Cause this is the third time you've helped me,<<CRLF>>I'll spare you all the details.<<CRLF>>
This time, you get to choose between an<<CRLF>>ultimate mace or an incredible halberd.<<CRLF>>
Which would you rather test?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FI'm sure as heck not choosing!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FWe'll defer judgment to you, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Choose the mace
Choose the halberd
All right, here you go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This time I want whoever equips this to defeat<<CRLF>>five 'Madogra-Slefs.' (Not a very elegant name, is<<CRLF>>that. If only they'd consulted me, you know?)
Seems like they're gonna be tough, too! I've<<CRLF>>been reading up on them, and they sound<<CRLF>>pretty mean.
No idea what they look like or where to find<<CRLF>>them, though. I only know that they're ferocious<<CRLF>>and deadly, and I want their blood on my steel!
And, well, you're the ones who crossed over into<<CRLF>>the Primeval Lands, so I'm sure you'll be able<<CRLF>>to find them somewhere or another.
Best of luck!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, looks like you finished the test!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wasn't my weapon amazing?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It was scary good.
It was a work of art.
#00405F...I'll agree with the 'scary' part, at least.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. You flatter me, Adol Christin!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now, so hang<<CRLF>>on a sec.<<CRLF>>
#00401FI don't think it's a work of art I'll ever be<<CRLF>>able to appreciate. That was terrifying!<<CRLF>>
Haha. It must have been rather 'gripping'<<CRLF>>indeed!<<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now, so hang<<CRLF>>on a sec.<<CRLF>>
It was chilling.
It was a work of art.
#00500FHeehee. It sure was!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FStill, it was certainly an interesting<<CRLF>>experience.<<CRLF>>
My, you're one brave lady!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now, so hang<<CRLF>>on a sec.<<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. It did have a certain charm<<CRLF>>to it.<<CRLF>>
I'm glad you both enjoyed the experience!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll get to work on refining it now, so hang<<CRLF>>on a sec.<<CRLF>>
There, it's done!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Behold, the Supreme Godl--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Dammit, Syriu, give it up already!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll give ya a break an' let ya call it the<<CRLF>>'Hyper Breaker,' but tha's as far as I go!<<CRLF>>
You're callin' it the Cruel Axe, 'cause it was<<CRLF>>cruel o' you to do this to these nice people,<<CRLF>>and tha's final!
Why?! At least let me finish!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* Just let me finish saying the name!<<CRLF>>I spent hours thinking of that one!<<CRLF>>
...I'm not gonna give up. Nosiree, I'm not<<CRLF>>calling it quits just yet. One day, people will<<CRLF>>appreciate my matchless naming sense!

#4CA new quest was added to Selray's quest board.
#3CThe quest 'Legendary Weapon' has been\nadded to your journal.
Hey there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Are you ready to bring a legend to life with me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...Dare I ask?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. Yes, please! Dare away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
See, a while ago, Gazock gave me an old book<<CRLF>>he found.<<CRLF>>
And inside it are details on how to craft an<<CRLF>>amazingly powerful weapon from some ancient<<CRLF>>civilization.
#00309FAn ancient weapon?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yeah, doesn't that sound amazing?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Just looking at the blueprints gets me all<<CRLF>>fired up. It's gonna be reaaaally strong!<<CRLF>>
The actual process of making it is pretty com-<<CRLF>>plex, though, so it's been really tough setting<<CRLF>>up the necessary experiments to fine-tune it.
#00300FExperiments? Are you suggesting that the<<CRLF>>tests we have completed...?<<CRLF>>
Haha, exactly! You've got good sense, Ozma.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All the tests you've been doing for me have<<CRLF>>been leading up to this.<<CRLF>>
So, getting down to business...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Being a really valuable ancient weapon, the<<CRLF>>material I need in order to make it is super<<CRLF>>duper rare.
Apparently it's called a 'Sun Stone,' and you<<CRLF>>can recognize it by the fact that it gives off<<CRLF>>some faint heat when you get near it.
#00305FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FSo you would like us to find one of these<<CRLF>>'Sun Stones' for you?<<CRLF>>
Yeah. How about it? Sound doable?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll give you the weapon I make with it, of<<CRLF>>course.<<CRLF>>
#00300FWe cannot promise anything, but if our<<CRLF>>assurance that the effort will be made is<<CRLF>>enough for you...
That's just fine by me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Best of luck, and happy hunting. I'll keep my<<CRLF>>fingers crossed for your success!<<CRLF>>
#00300FHere you are, Syriu.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wow, this is it! You actually found one!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
One Sun Stone should be enough for me to<<CRLF>>make one weapon.<<CRLF>>
The question is, who do you want me to make<<CRLF>>it for?<<CRLF>>
I can make all of the weapons you guys use,<<CRLF>>so anything at all would be just fine.<<CRLF>>
#00300FWhat do you feel would be best, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Make a weapon for me
Make a weapon for Duren
Make a weapon for Karna
Make a weapon for Ozma
Make a weapon for Calilica
Make a weapon for Frieda
All right! Here goes, then...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's finished! Behold, the legendary Ajax Sword!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here, try holding it and see what you think.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Lookin' good, Syriu!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Isn't it just awesome?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Take it with you. It's yours now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FThank you very much. Though I must<<CRLF>>say, I am quite surprised by its name.<<CRLF>>
It's oddly very normal.
It's kinda boring!
...Damned straight.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You say that as if all my other names have<<CRLF>>been weird!<<CRLF>>
I mean, this is just a replica of an ancient<<CRLF>>weapon. I didn't design this one from scratch<<CRLF>>or anything.
So it wouldn't really be right to just go<<CRLF>>changing the name!<<CRLF>>
I know, right?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Can't agree with ya there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wanted to give it a really awesome name,<<CRLF>>like I TRIED TO DO WITH ALL THE OTHERS...<<CRLF>>
But this is just a replica of an ancient weapon.<<CRLF>>I didn't design it from scratch or anything.<<CRLF>>
So it wouldn't really be right to just go<<CRLF>>changing the name.<<CRLF>>

#00103FThanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Oh? Tha's the spirit o' a blacksmith. Proud o'<<CRLF>>ya!<<CRLF>>
But of course!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
By the way, Master?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It looked like you were working on something<<CRLF>>of your own while I was making this.<<CRLF>>
What have you got there?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm? Oh, I was workin' on this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Take this with ya too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FIs this...armor?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhoa...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00309FThis is most impressive.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FMy...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FOh, my...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There was a bit o' Sun Stone left after Syriu<<CRLF>>finished makin' her ancient weapon.<<CRLF>>
So I looked in 'er book to see if I could make<<CRLF>>anythin' with it.<<CRLF>>
's an alloy of a bunch o' different metals, so<<CRLF>>it's much stronger than anythin' you'll find<<CRLF>>around 'ere.
How did you manage something like that in<<CRLF>>such a short amount of time?!<<CRLF>>
Haha! Saw ya doin' something excitin' and<<CRLF>>couldn't help joinin' the fun!<<CRLF>>
Can't have ya showin' off, now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Gahaha! See, Syriu? Ya've still got a ways t'<<CRLF>>go before ya can get the better o' me!<<CRLF>>
Ugh, everything's a competition with him...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, if ya find any more o' that Sun Stone,<<CRLF>>bring it over 'ere.<<CRLF>>
I'll whip up another o' my amazin' armors.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, this was my request! Get your own!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Why should you be the one to wrap things up<<CRLF>>here?!<<CRLF>>

H-hold on a moment, Rilche--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. What's the problem?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FYou should accept her thoughtful gesture.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FLooks to me like Rilche is just trying to<<CRLF>>help Cecily overcome her shyness and<<CRLF>>confess her true feelings. It's so sweet!
#00104FI-I think we all got that, Calilica. No need<<CRLF>>to make this any more awkward than it<<CRLF>>already is!

O-oh...of course!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

I don't know what we would have done without<<CRLF>>you. I truly admire your strength.<<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'A Swarm of Scarlet'!
Oh, do you want to know more about the<<CRLF>>Vesbiwars? Are you considering exterminating<<CRLF>>them for us?
They appear to be a subspecies of a type of<<CRLF>>giant spider called a 'Vesbinake'...<<CRLF>>
But what really makes this particular subspecies<<CRLF>>terrifying is its ability to reproduce rapidly,<<CRLF>>and its tendency to move in large groups.
And while the Jade Cave is far from here, there<<CRLF>>is no guarantee they won't approach the village<<CRLF>>in time.
It's happened before, so we can't be too<<CRLF>>careful. I'd really appreciate it if someone<<CRLF>>would get rid of them for us.
The thing you have to watch out for the most is<<CRLF>>their sheer numbers.<<CRLF>>
Make sure you're well stocked up on potions if<<CRLF>>you decide to try and exterminate them. You'll<<CRLF>>need every last drop, I fear!
Oh, you want to know more about the<<CRLF>>Vesbilzons?<<CRLF>>
They appear to be a mutation of the Vesbiwars.<<CRLF>>And they're significantly more powerful, too.<<CRLF>>
They're strong enough on their own, but much<<CRLF>>like the Vesbiwars, they reproduce rapidly.<<CRLF>>
If you decide to exterminate them, stay on<<CRLF>>guard.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure you know this after defeating the<<CRLF>>Vesbinakes, but this is not going to be a<<CRLF>>quick or easy task. Prepare for a long battle.
Make sure you're well stocked up on supplies<<CRLF>>before you go.<<CRLF>>
No one can be sure what will happen in the<<CRLF>>future.<<CRLF>>
But only we can choose the path we wish to<<CRLF>>take.<<CRLF>>
No matter what happens as a result of that<<CRLF>>choice, I don't want to look back and regret<<CRLF>>having made it.
The Romuns told us that there are people living<<CRLF>>in the Primeval Lands, too.<<CRLF>>
I wonder if we share the same ancestors...<<CRLF>>It's fascinating to think about.<<CRLF>>
It hasn't been easy here lately, but we get by.<<CRLF>>Our troubles aren't yet over, though, from the<<CRLF>>looks of it.
What's happening on the other side of the river?<<CRLF>>I get the shivers just thinking about it!<<CRLF>>
If you look across the river, you can see a<<CRLF>>tall tower now.<<CRLF>>
To think that all these years, something like<<CRLF>>that has been hidden just out of sight...<<CRLF>>
I'm interested in these 'Primeval Lands,' yet<<CRLF>>scared by the thought of actually going there.<<CRLF>>

Please, look after our Ozma. He's very dear<<CRLF>>to us.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure you don't need me to tell you, but you<<CRLF>>won't find many others who are even half as<<CRLF>>brave as he.
With him at your side, I'm sure nothing can<<CRLF>>stand in your way.<<CRLF>>

So it was a large outsider who poisoned the<<CRLF>>river?<<CRLF>>
I had thought you were the only ones who<<CRLF>>managed to come this deep into the forest.<<CRLF>>
But why would he want to do such a thing?<<CRLF>>It truly boggles the mind...<<CRLF>>

You seem like a good person, so I really don't<<CRLF>>want to have to suspect you.<<CRLF>>
But nothing like this has ever happened before,<<CRLF>>and we've never had a visitor from outside the<<CRLF>>forest...
So it just seems the most plausible explanation.<<CRLF>>Please try to understand our perspective.<<CRLF>>

Was that not enough for you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You can't be greedy. A tickle is a privilege,<<CRLF>>not a right! You've had enough for today.<<CRLF>>
Come back again some other time.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heeheehee.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Yes, please.
Very much no.

You want me to do it again?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sorry, you'll have to wait your turn.<<CRLF>>I'm booked solid right now.<<CRLF>>
Come back again when the moon is in the<<CRLF>>seventh house. Or...sometime. I don't know<<CRLF>>how long this backlog will take to get through.
Heeheehee.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, will you let me tickle you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Of course!
Of course not!
Heeheehee, you big tickle-lover!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Aww, you're no fun.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You want me to tickle you again?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You've had enough for today. You can't be<<CRLF>>greedy. The tickle is an art. It loses its<<CRLF>>'oomph' if you overindulge.
Come back again another day!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heeheehee.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, can I tickle you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sure.
Uh, no.
Yaaaaaay!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

...Don't you think you've had enough?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Besides, my arms are tired. But I'll do it again<<CRLF>>another day, okay?<<CRLF>>
Sounds like the Romuns are up to something.<<CRLF>>Just as long as they don't drag us into it. We<<CRLF>>want nothing to do with them.
I wish they'd just pull out of the forest<<CRLF>>already, but that doesn't seem likely...<<CRLF>>
When the mist disappeared, the river's current<<CRLF>>slowed down as well.<<CRLF>>
It does make fishing easier, but it feels like<<CRLF>>a bad omen somehow...<<CRLF>>
What do I know about the poison?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Nothing. It was just...there, all of a sudden.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I dunno what you're planning, but you should<<CRLF>>just give it up and confess already.<<CRLF>>
I wonder what we should do if the Romuns<<CRLF>>attack.<<CRLF>>
...With their numbers, I suppose all we really<<CRLF>>could do is run and hope for the best.<<CRLF>>
Outsiders wandering into the village, the river<<CRLF>>current changing, the mist vanishing...<<CRLF>>
What's going on around here lately?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're looking for info on the river?<<CRLF>>Sorry, you'll have to look elsewhere.<<CRLF>>
We know nothing of value to you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

All right, time to get to work!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Rilche has been looking out for me all this<<CRLF>>time.<<CRLF>>
Heehee. Well...it did make me really happy,<<CRLF>>I have to admit. It was embarrassing too,<<CRLF>>of course, but...I appreciate the thought.
I'll have to stop those Romun soldiers if they<<CRLF>>try to ride the Spardas without permission<<CRLF>>again.
...Although that man with the strange hair isn't<<CRLF>>here today, so maybe they'll behave.<<CRLF>>
All of the adult Spardas are out fishing at the<<CRLF>>moment.<<CRLF>>
So I'm taking this chance to clean the place.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I think the Spardas were as surprised by the<<CRLF>>sudden change in the current as we were.<<CRLF>>
I wonder if something happened in the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands that caused it...<<CRLF>>
Oh, Ozma...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI am truly sorry for the trouble, Cecily.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI feel guilty leaving the Spardas' care to<<CRLF>>you in my absence.<<CRLF>>

I'm honored to have the privilege of fulfilling<<CRLF>>such an important role.<<CRLF>>

I'm still a little uneasy about people from<<CRLF>>outside the forest, what with the poisoning of<<CRLF>>the river and all...
Cecily may have a lot to learn about Sparda<<CRLF>>care, but her devotion to the job is admirable.<<CRLF>>
She's such a good girl. I'm so proud to have her<<CRLF>>as my daughter!<<CRLF>>
I never thought I'd see the day we could clearly<<CRLF>>view the opposite shore.<<CRLF>>
I've been alive for a long time, but never have<<CRLF>>I seen anything like it before.<<CRLF>>
If you're looking for Cecily, she's with the<<CRLF>>Spardas.<<CRLF>>
She's always been a hard worker, so as long as<<CRLF>>she's with them, you can rest assured they'll<<CRLF>>be well cared for.
I'm happy to hear you were able to clear your<<CRLF>>name.<<CRLF>>
You're always welcome back here in Selray.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I heard you're trying to find the one who<<CRLF>>poisoned the river.<<CRLF>>
I don't want to believe you did it, and Cecily<<CRLF>>doesn't either.<<CRLF>>
So I hope you can find the real criminal.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's always possible that the Romuns might try<<CRLF>>and invade the village.<<CRLF>>

There are many in the village who think of<<CRLF>>outsiders coming to the village as a bad<<CRLF>>thing...
But I don't see the harm in interacting with<<CRLF>>people from other places.<<CRLF>>
I think everyone is getting used to life in<<CRLF>>Selray without Ozma.<<CRLF>>
It can be difficult to change your ways, but if<<CRLF>>change leads to growth and maturation, it can<<CRLF>>only be a good thing.
I can't believe the mist over the river has<<CRLF>>vanished...<<CRLF>>
The current has slowed down, making it easier<<CRLF>>to fish...but it's such a drastic change, I have to<<CRLF>>admit it's also put us all a bit on edge.
It's hard to imagine this village without Ozma,<<CRLF>>but it would be selfish of us to try and stop him.<<CRLF>>
We may be without our leader, but we can still<<CRLF>>maintain order by combining our efforts. It will<<CRLF>>be hard, but we'll do our best.
It's good you found the real culprit, though<<CRLF>>it's a shame you couldn't capture him and bring<<CRLF>>him to justice.
I hope nothing like that ever happens again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Even if it would give us the chance to<<CRLF>>capture the man who did it...<<CRLF>>
I hope nothing like that ever happens again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Even if it would give us the chance to<<CRLF>>capture the man who did it...<<CRLF>>
You really don't look like the kind of person<<CRLF>>who'd poison a river.<<CRLF>>
But I suppose I'll just have to wait and see<<CRLF>>how your investigation goes.<<CRLF>>
Griselda has assured us she means us no harm.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
She also says that she would like to leave the<<CRLF>>Great Forest as it is.<<CRLF>>
I'm going to have to visit Comodo again in<<CRLF>>the near future and discuss matters with Asad.<<CRLF>>He might have good input on this.
As I said to Asad, the Romuns seem to be a<<CRLF>>very varied bunch.<<CRLF>>
Though some have been friendly, a group of<<CRLF>>masked soldiers passed by the village recently,<<CRLF>>raising some concern.
We will need to remain vigilant.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Perhaps we have been too reliant on Ozma<<CRLF>>all this time.<<CRLF>>
Particularly since his parents passed away...<<CRLF>>It must have been quite a burden on him.<<CRLF>>
I know that your reason for crossing over to the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands is not for selfish gain.<<CRLF>>
So there is no need to feel ashamed. Go with<<CRLF>>your head held high!<<CRLF>>
#00301FThank you for your kind words, Cirrus.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I know that your reason for crossing over to<<CRLF>>the Primeval Lands is not for selfish gain.<<CRLF>>
So there is no need to feel ashamed. Go with<<CRLF>>head held high!<<CRLF>>
Perhaps we have been too reliant on Ozma<<CRLF>>all this time.<<CRLF>>
Particularly since his parents passed away...<<CRLF>>It must have been hard on him.<<CRLF>>
Maybe this is a good opportunity to rethink<<CRLF>>the way things are done here.<<CRLF>>
Maybe this is a good opportunity to rethink<<CRLF>>the way things are done here.<<CRLF>>
So the devil who poisoned the river is named<<CRLF>>Gadis? It seems catching him will be no easy<<CRLF>>task.
Either way, it's clear that not all who come<<CRLF>>from outside Selray have the same intentions.<<CRLF>>
If only they could all be like you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ah, it's you again. Thank you for your recent<<CRLF>>efforts.<<CRLF>>
If only all of those who entered the forest were<<CRLF>>like you...<<CRLF>>
You intend to find the real culprit?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, investigate for as long as you'd like.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But if you can't find another culprit, you had<<CRLF>>best be prepared for the consequences.<<CRLF>>
Well, investigate for as long as you'd like.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But if you can't find another culprit, you had<<CRLF>>best be prepared for the consequences.<<CRLF>>
Adol! I heard you proved your innocence!<<CRLF>>I'm so happy for you...<<CRLF>>
Now you just need to get your memory back!<<CRLF>>Although I suppose there's no rushing that one.<<CRLF>>
Just take it easy. Let it all come back to you<<CRLF>>bit by bit.<<CRLF>>
Now you just need to get your memory back!<<CRLF>>Although I suppose there's no rushing that one.<<CRLF>>
Just take it easy. Let it all come back to you<<CRLF>>bit by bit.<<CRLF>>
Oh, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's great to see you! Didn't think you'd come<<CRLF>>back here.<<CRLF>>
Who might you be?
It's nice to meet you.
My name's Gazock. I'm--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16S...Wait, you're not serious, are you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You didn't forget me...did you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, no, the pleasure's all mine. My name's<<CRLF>>Gazock, and...<<CRLF>>
#16S...Wait, why am I introducing myself<<CRLF>>when we've met before?!<<CRLF>>
You're joking, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You couldn't have forgotten me...could you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FActually...yeah, he forgot you, for sure.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol and Duren explained the situation to Gazock.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You lost your memories?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm. I see. That's terrible...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FHuh. You're a lot more understanding than<<CRLF>>the other villagers.<<CRLF>>
Well, Adol and I became good friends when he<<CRLF>>last stopped by.<<CRLF>>
I can't believe people suspect you'd poison the<<CRLF>>river! I know you'd never do such a thing.<<CRLF>>
I wish there were something I could do to help.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But I've spent so much of my time in the forest<<CRLF>>lately, I doubt anyone's going to believe any<<CRLF>>defense I could put together.
#00112FIn the forest? What were you doing<<CRLF>>there?<<CRLF>>
#00301FOne of Gazock's interests is exploring old<<CRLF>>ruins.<<CRLF>>
Haha. Yep.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I lived in the forest all by my lonesome until<<CRLF>>a few decades ago. I got pretty used to it,<<CRLF>>really.
#00110FYou're kidding... Man, you must be pretty<<CRLF>>tough to have survived in a place like that<<CRLF>>for so long.
Wahaha! But of course!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That's why people call me 'Gazock the Strong'!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh! But don't let me hold you up.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Looks like you've got more important things<<CRLF>>to do than stand around and chitchat.<<CRLF>>
#00305FWe apologize for taking up your time as<<CRLF>>well.<<CRLF>>
#00100FCome on, let's get back to asking around.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's awful to hear you lost your memories.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Still, try not to worry about it too much.<<CRLF>>Worrying won't do a thing to help you.<<CRLF>>
#4CVarious quests are displayed on the board.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Blond Youth
When I heard of someone crossing the forest,<<CRLF>>I had expected a well-built adult warrior.<<CRLF>>
I had not expected a delicately-built young<<CRLF>>man, younger even than I.<<CRLF>>
Regardless...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F#0351VI honor the skill and courage you have<<CRLF>>displayed by crossing the territory of<<CRLF>>the beasts.
#00300F#0352VMy name is Ozma.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F#0353VMy tribe is responsible for rearing the<<CRLF>>sacred beasts known as Spardas, and<<CRLF>>I currently serve as Selray's leader.
I want to know more about the Spardas.
Aren't you a bit young to be a leader?
#00305FYou seem to be a very inquisitive person.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FI can see why the fishermen were coerced<<CRLF>>into bringing you here.<<CRLF>>
#00300FIs everyone from the outside like that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FTraditionally, the head of my tribe has<<CRLF>>also been the leader of this village.<<CRLF>>
#00300FAnd thus I now serve that function.<<CRLF>>There is...nothing more to the matter<<CRLF>>than that.
#00305FSince you are here...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIf you wish to know more about life in<<CRLF>>this village, I will gladly tell you of the<<CRLF>>sacred beasts.
#00300FWe keep the Spardas in the building to<<CRLF>>the west of here.<<CRLF>>
#00300FCome with me and I will show them to<<CRLF>>you.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThis is the building where we raise the<<CRLF>>Spardas.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThe livelihoods of everyone in this village<<CRLF>>are sustained by fishing.<<CRLF>>
#00300FHowever, the rapids swirl perilously, and<<CRLF>>the river has many different depths along<<CRLF>>its course.
#00300FGiven those conditions, can you imagine<<CRLF>>what it would be like to fish on a boat?<<CRLF>>
You wouldn't be able to catch anything.
The boat would be smashed to pieces.
#00305FYou would not. But more significantly, you<<CRLF>>would be swept along with the current<<CRLF>>and pulled toward the forests' center.
#00305FNot quite. But you would be swept along<<CRLF>>with the current and pulled toward the<<CRLF>>center of the forest.
#00300F...You have a distant look in your eyes.<<CRLF>>Is everything all right?<<CRLF>>
#00300FAt any rate, this is why the Spardas are<<CRLF>>useful here, as they can freely swim in<<CRLF>>the rapids.
#00305FThe fishermen of Selray fish while riding<<CRLF>>these creatures.<<CRLF>>
#00305FWithout the Spardas, we would not be<<CRLF>>able to survive in this environment.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThey are the beasts granted to us through<<CRLF>>divine providence to enable our survival.<<CRLF>>Thus, we call them sacred beasts.
#00300F...Ah, but I must be boring you with this<<CRLF>>endless history. Why talk about them<<CRLF>>when they're right here to be met?
#00300FTake a closer look.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FTheir limbs and tail allow them to swim<<CRLF>>freely through even the most turbulent of<<CRLF>>rapids.
#00305FAnd the protuberances along their body,<<CRLF>>particularly on the head, provide the ideal<<CRLF>>body for treading water at high speeds.
#00300FThose blades on their head, in fact, are<<CRLF>>the origin of the name 'Sparda,' which is<<CRLF>>an old term for the edge of a sword.
#00305FWhile they are technically beasts, Spardas<<CRLF>>are docile and intelligent.<<CRLF>>
#00305FThey obey the orders of the villagers with<<CRLF>>little resistance, and rarely act violently.<<CRLF>>
#00305FWe attach saddles and stirrups to them<<CRLF>>so the fishermen can climb on top.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThis building is the only place in Selray<<CRLF>>where the Spardas are raised.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThe reason for this is that I am forbidden<<CRLF>>from telling the other villagers how to rear<<CRLF>>and care for them.
Why?
Don't you have any other family?
#00305FBecause that is the law of my tribe.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FAnd I am now the last remaining member<<CRLF>>of that tribe...<<CRLF>>
#00305FBoth of my parents passed when I was<<CRLF>>younger, you see.<<CRLF>>
#00300FSo I am the only villager remaining who<<CRLF>>can care for the Spardas.<<CRLF>>
#00304F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThat is an infant Sparda.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's so cute.
Was it born here?
#00305FSpardas develop very quickly, so it will not<<CRLF>>stay that way for long. It will soon become<<CRLF>>much larger.
#00305FNo, no Sparda has ever been born here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FSpardas originate from upstream.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWe bring them here when they are infants<<CRLF>>and raise them in this village.<<CRLF>>
#00300FSo, has your curiosity about the Spardas<<CRLF>>been sated now?<<CRLF>>
#00305FIt is late. I think that is enough for one<<CRLF>>day.<<CRLF>>
I want to ride one.
I want to care for one.
#00301FI have no objections to that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00306FIt is unique, to suggest something like<<CRLF>>that without a second thought. You will<<CRLF>>likely feel sick at first.
#00306F...Though I somehow doubt that will<<CRLF>>discourage you.<<CRLF>>
#00301FYou appear obedient, but it seems you<<CRLF>>can be surprisingly stubborn.<<CRLF>>
#00305FAs I just explained, I cannot allow anyone<<CRLF>>else to take care of the Spardas. Naturally,<<CRLF>>that includes you as well.
#00305FHowever, I am intending to ride one out<<CRLF>>onto the river, to familiarize it with human<<CRLF>>behavior and expectations.
#00301FI will choose a docile one for you, if you<<CRLF>>would like to ride it alongside me.<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol was given permission by Ozma to take a closer look at<<CRLF>>the Spardas. <<CRLF>>
But enough of that. I found this a few days<<CRLF>>ago. It's...<<CRLF>>
And this is...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wahaha! It's not often I find someone who<<CRLF>>understands me quite like you do!<<CRLF>>
It's been a long time since I've been able to<<CRLF>>talk at such great length about the Great Forest<<CRLF>>to anyone.
But I'm afraid I can't describe all of my<<CRLF>>exploits in just one day!<<CRLF>>
So don't expect to get any sleep tonight.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No worries, I'm up for it.
Are you sure that's healthy?
Wahaha! That's what I wanted to hear! I knew<<CRLF>>you were good for it!<<CRLF>>
Well, then, where were we?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wahaha! I appreciate the concern, but there's<<CRLF>>no need to worry about me!<<CRLF>>
I'm not called Gazock the Strong for nothing.<<CRLF>>All-nighters are my life's blood!<<CRLF>>
Girl's Voice
Hey-ho!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, hello, Zara. Did you need something?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheh. You know what I need.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Time for tickles!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've come to tickle you both senseless!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
O-oh. I see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But we're in the middle of an important<<CRLF>>conversation right now, so--<<CRLF>>
Spec-TICKULAR!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Nooooo! Noooooooo!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CZara successfully put Gazock to sleep.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha! Victory!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And now it's your turn...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heh. Just kidding!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's okay, everyone, you can come in now!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm, looks like Gazock is fast asleep.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Haha. Good, good.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I feel a little sorry for him, but we didn't<<CRLF>>have much other choice.<<CRLF>>
Yeah. As soon as he starts talking about his<<CRLF>>adventures in the forest, he's gone.<<CRLF>>
Yeah, and we can't have him keeping Adol all<<CRLF>>to himself!<<CRLF>>
#00305F*sigh* I did try to oppose such extreme<<CRLF>>measures, I assure you.<<CRLF>>
Heheh. You could've tried harder to stop us!<<CRLF>>You're just as guilty as we are!<<CRLF>>
H-hahaha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who cares. It's party time!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Though we should probably do somethin' 'bout<<CRLF>>Gazock 'ere.<<CRLF>>
C'mon, Syriu, we're carryin' him t' the bed.<<CRLF>>Grab 'is legs.<<CRLF>>
Why me?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Shaddap and do as yer told!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CSelray was filled with excitement at Adol's arrival.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAnd that excitement went on through the night...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp3301.JSON_TEXT 10 >>
#00300FThis area appears to have filled with<<CRLF>>water.<<CRLF>>
#00109FLook, there's a staircase on the other<<CRLF>>side.<<CRLF>>
#00300FIndeed. But the water seems to have<<CRLF>>eroded the path, putting it just out of our<<CRLF>>reach.
#00300FAdol, we should investigate the area and<<CRLF>>see if we can find another way to reach<<CRLF>>the staircase.
#00109FLooks like the wall under the water has<<CRLF>>seen better days...<<CRLF>>
#00300FThis ruin is several hundred years old, so<<CRLF>>such a thing is to be expected.<<CRLF>>
#00300FBut I imagine with fissures that size, the<<CRLF>>wall should be brittle enough to break<<CRLF>>with my spear.
#00100FBreak the wall so the water flows out?<<CRLF>>Sounds like an idea...<<CRLF>>
#00100FTry not to bring the whole place down<<CRLF>>on our heads and we're golden!<<CRLF>>
#00305FHah. There is no need for concern. My<<CRLF>>touch is...a delicate one.<<CRLF>>
<< mp3302.JSON_TEXT 5 >>
#00109FWhoa...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWouldn't have guessed this place was<<CRLF>>so big from the outside.<<CRLF>>
#00305FLikewise. Truth be told, I have yet to<<CRLF>>explore it in its entirety myself.<<CRLF>>
#00100FReally? Guess we'll just have to do the<<CRLF>>honors now, then...<<CRLF>>
#00300FDo be cautious. There are many dangers<<CRLF>>lurking in these depths.<<CRLF>>
<< mp3306.JSON_TEXT 2 >>
#00100FLooks like...some kind of ancient treasure?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI can feel a strange power coming off it.<<CRLF>>It's just gathering dust here, so we might<<CRLF>>as well put it to good use, right?
<< mp3311.JSON_TEXT 7 >>
#00109FThis is one huge door.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FHmm... Has some kinda hole in it. Maybe<<CRLF>>you're supposed to put something in there,<<CRLF>>like a sort of key.
#00101FPretty complicated locking mechanism,<<CRLF>>but should be a piece of cake to get open,<<CRLF>>if we've got something that'll fit!
#00109FHmm... This is just like that other door<<CRLF>>we found.<<CRLF>>
#00101FThis one has a similar hole in it, too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FI guess it's opened the same way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWe should keep moving.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp3312.JSON_TEXT 20 >>
#00111F*gasp*<<CRLF>>   *inhale*<<CRLF>>
#00103FFresh air!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FDon't care if we can breathe underwater<<CRLF>>or not, people still belong on land, dammit!<<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd that fish...<<CRLF>>Man, Adol, that thing was enormous!<<CRLF>>
#00300FLook there!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...Wasn't that the baby Sparda that was<<CRLF>>being chased earlier?<<CRLF>>
#00101FIt looked terrified, the poor thing...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FOh, you've gotta be kidding me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00110F#16SIt's baaaaaaaaaack!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00302FOogh... We have no choice. We must<<CRLF>>stand our ground!<<CRLF>>
#00111FWhew... That thing just wouldn't give up!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FMuch as we would all like to rest now,<<CRLF>>I must continue to pursue that infant<<CRLF>>Sparda without delay.
What's wrong?
Are you going to catch it?
#00300FI am simply...concerned about something.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FFor now, let us proceed farther inside.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FNo, there would be no point in catching it.<<CRLF>>Come, let us proceed farther inside.<<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* No rest for the weary, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI must pursue that infant Sparda right<<CRLF>>now. My apologies.<<CRLF>>
#00100FOh well. Do what you gotta do, I guess!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp3313.JSON_TEXT 104 >>
#00300FThere it is...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304F...I feared as much.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CA couple of knives are piercing the infant Sparda's body.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThis is awful! Who'd do something like<<CRLF>>this?<<CRLF>>
#00300FI don't know, but it will die if it is not<<CRLF>>treated immediately.<<CRLF>>
#4COzma produced several tools from his bag and skillfully treated the<<CRLF>>infant Sparda's injuries.<<CRLF>>
#00301F...That should do it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Nice job.
Whose knives were those?
#00305FIt was nothing.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FThe Spardas that assist us in fishing<<CRLF>>quite often suffer injuries.<<CRLF>>
#00300FBut the question of who did this to the<<CRLF>>poor creature still remains unanswered.<<CRLF>>
#00109FYou sure you're the only one who comes<<CRLF>>in and out of this place?<<CRLF>>
#00300FI cannot even fathom a guess.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FSeems obvious the culprit's a human, at<<CRLF>>least...<<CRLF>>
#00109FYou sure you're the only one who comes<<CRLF>>in and out of this place?<<CRLF>>
#00300F...As I said earlier, only people of my<<CRLF>>tribe are allowed to enter here.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThis is the first time I have come so far<<CRLF>>in myself.<<CRLF>>
#00110FWhoa. That's...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FHere they come...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00108FAre these wild Spardas?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
They've got tusks!
They're bigger than the ones in Selray!
#00109FNo kidding...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FDid the Spardas in Selray have those?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FYeah. A lot bigger.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...When we capture them as infants, the<<CRLF>>first thing we do is break their tusks.<<CRLF>>
#00300FWithout them, they become more docile<<CRLF>>and are unable to spew their poison.<<CRLF>>
#00300FHowever, they do not grow as large as<<CRLF>>wild Spardas, and become a slightly<<CRLF>>different color.
#00101FWell, that explains the difference in<<CRLF>>appearance, at least...<<CRLF>>
#00110FCraaap...<<CRLF>>They don't seem too happy with us.<<CRLF>>
#00300FTraditionally, we take only one of a group<<CRLF>>of newborn Spardas, but in stealth so<<CRLF>>the older creatures are none the wiser.
#00300FBut this infant is older, and quite heavily<<CRLF>>wounded. And I suspect we are to take<<CRLF>>the blame for that.
#00111FYeah, can't blame 'em for being mad, all<<CRLF>>things considered. But check out the water.<<CRLF>>It's full of poison!
#00101FSo does that mean the poison in the<<CRLF>>river...<<CRLF>>
#00305FIndeed, these Spardas were likely its<<CRLF>>source.<<CRLF>>
#00104FWell at least now we know. But that<<CRLF>>doesn't help us get out of this mess...<<CRLF>>
#00104FThere's no way we can take all of these<<CRLF>>on at once!<<CRLF>>
#00101FWhat do we do, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We'll have to fight!
Let's try breaking through!
#00305F...I am not certain I can bring myself to<<CRLF>>fight with the sacred beasts.<<CRLF>>
#00111FDoesn't look like we've got much choice!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FIf we don't do something fast...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI believe we have no other choice.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102FOkay! On the count of three, we make<<CRLF>>our move. One...two...<<CRLF>>
#00109F...Wait, what's going on?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309F#00367VThis is...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...Huh, they're...leaving?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...Don't tell me the little guy convinced<<CRLF>>them not to fight with us...<<CRLF>>
#00309F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00108FWh-who are...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00108FWhoa! Where did you come from?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...Who are you? You're not from the<<CRLF>>village.<<CRLF>>
#10302F#16S#0681V#2MI'm Gadis, the beast tamer.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10302F#0682V#2MAnd I was taming that beast long before<<CRLF>>you got here and screwed everything up!<<CRLF>>
#00300FTaming?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FThat's blasphemy! These are sacred<<CRLF>>beasts!<<CRLF>>
#10305FSacred? Blasphemy?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10302FYou thick in the head or something?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300FWhat's so sacred about a bunch of<<CRLF>>poison-spewin' animals?!<<CRLF>>
#00300F#16S...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300FI was wonderin' what earned them the<<CRLF>>title of 'sacred' here. Thought they must<<CRLF>>have some kind of mystical power.
#10300FI had no idea it was just because your<<CRLF>>people are a bunch of boneheads who<<CRLF>>can't think for themselves!
#10300FSo I figured, long as I'm here, I may as<<CRLF>>well tame a bunch of 'em to fight for me.<<CRLF>>Couldn't hurt, you know?
#00101FIs this guy for real...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10302FHey, blond kid! Your village looks after<<CRLF>>those things, right?<<CRLF>>
#10302FIs your tribe just a bunch of con artists,<<CRLF>>or what?<<CRLF>>
#00302FYou... How dare you call my tribe...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300FMy mistake! You're a proud, honorable<<CRLF>>group of zealots who take care of these<<CRLF>>'sacred' poisonous, carnivorous monsters!

#00307F#00287V#16SUgh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102FOzma! You okay?!<<CRLF>>...What the hell is this guy?!<<CRLF>>
Don't be rash. You'll just get hurt.
He's no pushover, that's for sure...
#00305FDo not concern yourself with me...Adol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00302FI simply cannot stand by and listen to<<CRLF>>my tribe and family being insulted!<<CRLF>>
#10300FHaha. Listen to the red-haired one. I'm<<CRLF>>not to be underestimated.<<CRLF>>
#00302FYour strength is of no concern to me. I<<CRLF>>cannot stand by and listen to my tribe and<<CRLF>>family being insulted!
#10300FHey, blond kid, here's a question for ya.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10306FYou snap their tusks to stop 'em from<<CRLF>>spewin' poison, all for your own selfish<<CRLF>>needs, right?
#10302FWell, I tame 'em through pain. How's<<CRLF>>that any different from what you do? Go<<CRLF>>on, tell me! I dare ya!
#00308F#00363V...Grr...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300FHaha. No answer? Course not!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300FSubjugate 'em and make 'em obey ya...<<CRLF>>That's the only way people and beasts<<CRLF>>can live together.
#10306FLaws and tribal traditions don't mean a<<CRLF>>thing.<<CRLF>>
#10300FWe're doin' the same damned thing here,<<CRLF>>you just try to make it sound like it's all<<CRLF>>sunshine and roses when you do it.
#10302F#16SKinda pathetic, if you ask me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300F...What's wrong? Got no comeback?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10305FThis is just sad now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300FI'm not wastin' any more time here.<<CRLF>>There's no point!<<CRLF>>
#00102FW-wait!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0M#00685VBlond kid.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI was gonna kill you, but you're not even worth<<CRLF>>it.<<CRLF>>
#0MBefore we meet again, make sure ya grow up<<CRLF>>a little more, okay? Make me mad enough that<<CRLF>>I wanna kill ya. Ain't no fun otherwise!
#0M#00679V#16SGAHAHAHAHAHA!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00307F#00363V#2MUgh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00312F#00358V#18S#2MDAMMIT!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp3401.JSON_TEXT 82 >>
#00309FI had no idea you would be such a<<CRLF>>natural at this, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00300FBut I feel I should probably warn you<<CRLF>>of one thing. Take a look at the opposite<<CRLF>>shore.
#00300FThe currents become significantly faster as<<CRLF>>one approaches. Even on a Sparda, it is not<<CRLF>>possible to cross the river completely.
#00300FI would urge you not to get too close.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So how DO you cross over there?
What's over there?
#00300FNo one knows. No one has ever been<<CRLF>>able to cross the river safely to find out.<<CRLF>>
#00300FWe refer to the area on the opposite<<CRLF>>shore as the 'Primeval Lands.'<<CRLF>>
#00300FNo one knows...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FNo one has ever been able to cross the<<CRLF>>river safely to find out.<<CRLF>>
#00300FWe refer to the area on the opposite shore<<CRLF>>as the 'Primeval Lands.'<<CRLF>>
#00305FIt is said that the Spardas which now live<<CRLF>>here originated from those lands.<<CRLF>>
#00305FThe Spardas are sacred beasts, bestowed<<CRLF>>upon this world by God.<<CRLF>>
#00300FSome believe God resides in the Primeval<<CRLF>>Lands even now, but since we are unable<<CRLF>>to confirm, none can say with certainty.
#00104FUgh... I feel sick...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FAdol...I can't...believe you're...okay with...<<CRLF>>all this...thrashing...<<CRLF>>
#00112FIs that...a bird? Lucky thing, up there all<<CRLF>>graceful while we're stuck down here on<<CRLF>>these...these things...
#00109FOh, crap, is that...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Poison?!
It's quite a contrast!
#00101FSure looks that way. Looks just like what<<CRLF>>they described in Selray...<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah. I can see why this would've tipped<<CRLF>>off the people of Selray that something<<CRLF>>was really not right!
#00109F...Isn't it harmful to the Spardas?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...This should be far enough.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MAdol, I feel I must apologize to you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F#0MWh-what? Why now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That's a good question. Why now?
You don't need to apologize.
#0MThat is why I brought you here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MYou are a very forgiving person, Adol. And you<<CRLF>>do not ask uncomfortable questions of others.<<CRLF>>But you deserve to hear the truth.
#0MI know the culprit that poisoned the river.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...Huh? Really?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FSo why'd you keep quiet about it all this<<CRLF>>time?<<CRLF>>
#00304FMy reason hardly makes up for all that<<CRLF>>you have been through...<<CRLF>>
#00304FAs you suspect, the poison was not put<<CRLF>>into the river by a human.<<CRLF>>
#00300F...Rather, it was the Spardas themselves<<CRLF>>who befouled the water.<<CRLF>>
#00110F#16SWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FFar upstream lies a Sparda breeding<<CRLF>>ground.<<CRLF>>
#00300FI am almost certain that they are<<CRLF>>responsible for this incident.<<CRLF>>
#00112FHold on, aren't the Spardas sacred beasts?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FWhat kind of sacred beast goes around<<CRLF>>poisoning rivers?!<<CRLF>>
#00304FThe Spardas raised in Selray are not able<<CRLF>>to do so.<<CRLF>>
#00304FWild Spardas, however, are known to<<CRLF>>secrete a poisonous substance when<<CRLF>>they become excited or scared.
#00109FSeriously?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Why didn't you tell us before?
Do the villagers know about this?
#00305FI am truly sorry...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FNo, the villagers have no idea.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThe people of my tribe have raised<<CRLF>>Spardas for ages, all the while obeying<<CRLF>>the ancient laws pertaining to them.
#00300FAnd those laws forbid us from telling<<CRLF>>others the secrets of the Sparda.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThis includes the fact that wild Spardas<<CRLF>>bear poison.<<CRLF>>
#00105FSo your reason for bringing us all the way<<CRLF>>out here was to keep anyone else from<<CRLF>>hearing you?!
#00101F...Does that mean something like this has<<CRLF>>happened before?<<CRLF>>
#00305FAs far as I am aware, this quantity of<<CRLF>>poison has never been found in the river<<CRLF>>prior to now.
#00305FThose not of my tribe are forbidden to<<CRLF>>approach the wild Spardas' breeding ground,<<CRLF>>and have been for as long as I know.
#00300FI was told that this was to avoid angering<<CRLF>>them, but of course, protecting their secrets<<CRLF>>was also of the utmost concern.
What could have caused this?
Let's go upstream.
#00304FSadly, I have no answer to that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FI would have to go upstream and invest-<<CRLF>>igate the matter myself in order to find<<CRLF>>out.
#00304F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FWait a second. Adol, you know what this<<CRLF>>means, right?<<CRLF>>
#00105FWe're not allowed in the Spardas' breeding<<CRLF>>ground!<<CRLF>>
#00105FWhich means we just have to leave this to<<CRLF>>Ozma while we go back to the village and<<CRLF>>relax!
#00304FActually...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWhile I realize it is quite brazen of me to<<CRLF>>ask for a favor after causing you so much<<CRLF>>trouble...
#00300FI would be most appreciative if the two<<CRLF>>of you would come with me.<<CRLF>>
#00109F...Why?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FUseless creature! Why won't you move?<<CRLF>>We need to go to the opposite shore!<<CRLF>>
#10505FMaybe the three of us are too heavy for<<CRLF>>it?<<CRLF>>
#10000F...Panza. Off you get.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FWhy me?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FStop complaining and go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10504FC-commander, it's going to get even<<CRLF>>angrier if you keep shouting--!<<CRLF>>
#10505F*sigh* I did warn you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FSancho, we're gonna get swept away!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SCurse you, foul beast! Men, swim!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Leo, Sancho and Panza
#16S#00938VHeeeeeeeeeeeeelp!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp3401m.JSON_TEXT 10 >>
#00301FYou truly are an unusual visitor.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FYou appear to have even more interest<<CRLF>>in the Primeval Lands than the people of<<CRLF>>this village do.
#00301F...Though I suppose that inquisitiveness<<CRLF>>is what allowed you to come this far<<CRLF>>into the forest to begin with.
#00306FPerhaps you might actually be able to<<CRLF>>reach it one day.<<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FAdol, if such a time should come...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304F...No, I suppose that is too much to hope<<CRLF>>for.<<CRLF>>
#00305FMy apologies, Adol. Please forget I said<<CRLF>>anything. We should be returning to the<<CRLF>>village now.
#00301FIt seems my people wish to hold a<<CRLF>>welcoming party for you.<<CRLF>>
#00301FAnd I would not want to be the one<<CRLF>>responsible for our guest of honor<<CRLF>>showing up late.
<< mp4103.JSON_TEXT 1 >>
#4CAdol's maximum HP increased by 10.
<< mp4201.JSON_TEXT 560 >>
#00309FIncredible...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FThis place is even more unbelievable up<<CRLF>>close!<<CRLF>>
#00101FI wonder what kind of people live here?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FHey, what're those twirly things over<<CRLF>>there?<<CRLF>>
#00101FThey're called windmills.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThe wind spins them around to generate<<CRLF>>energy.<<CRLF>>
#00209FOoh. Wow. I'm impressed you knew the<<CRLF>>answer, Duren. Very nice!<<CRLF>>
#00100FHey, they don't call me an information<<CRLF>>dealer for nothing. Anyway...<<CRLF>>
#00105FBased on our experiences so far, it seems<<CRLF>>safe to assume that Adol's caused some<<CRLF>>kinda trouble here, too.
#00306FHeh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FHahaha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FWe might get chased around. We might<<CRLF>>get locked in a house somewhere for a<<CRLF>>while. Who knows?
#00111FEither way, we can't stand around forever,<<CRLF>>so let's just get this over with.<<CRLF>>
Y...y...you're...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* Aaaaaand here we go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FOwn up, Adol. What did you do this<<CRLF>>time?<<CRLF>>
#18SIt's a ghoooooost!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...Huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wh-what's going on here?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's Adol! He's come back to haunt us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Eeeeek! This isn't your world any longer!<<CRLF>>Go back to sleep! Leave us be!<<CRLF>>
#00305FI see... So it was the people of this town<<CRLF>>who dug that grave, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThey appear to be under the impression<<CRLF>>that you are, in fact, deceased.<<CRLF>>
#00408FU-umm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FAdol, is that you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who are you?
Long time no see.
#00412F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00412F*stare*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00412FDo you actually remember me? You look<<CRLF>>pretty confused.<<CRLF>>
#00409F#0450V...Oh, I see... You've lost your memories.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400F#0451VWell then, let me introduce myself again.<<CRLF>>I'm Calilica.<<CRLF>>
#00411F#0453VIt's a pleasure to meet you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My name is Adol...
How'd you know I'd lost my memories?
#00402F#16SI know that, silly!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402F#16SThat's beside the point!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FYou really are quite the troublemaker,<<CRLF>>you know?<<CRLF>>
#00401FFirst you wander off outside the town<<CRLF>>without permission and disappear<<CRLF>>without a trace...
#00401FAnd then you show up here again. With<<CRLF>>no memories! The nerve of some people,<<CRLF>>I swear!
#00405FI like that you're an interesting person.<<CRLF>>But there are limits, you know. After a<<CRLF>>while, it just gets old!
#00401FYou're almost a full-grown adult, so you<<CRLF>>really need to start acting like one, okay?<<CRLF>>
#00112FW-wow, Adol, this kid...doesn't mince<<CRLF>>words, does she?<<CRLF>>
#00411F*ahem* Now, I think that about covers<<CRLF>>the scoldings. So, if you would, please<<CRLF>>come with me!
#00400FI'll show you to my home.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100F...Right, I think we've been about<<CRLF>>everywhere in town now.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWe should have enough information<<CRLF>>to work with, so let's head back to the<<CRLF>>mayor's place and regroup.
#00300FYes. We must decide our next course of<<CRLF>>action.<<CRLF>>
#00400FMeanwhile, I'm afraid I have some<<CRLF>>business to attend to, so I must bid<<CRLF>>you adieu.
#00400FI'll see you again later. Byeee!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThe north exit leads to the tower, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FThe shops still seem to be open, so we<<CRLF>>can stock up on supplies before we leave.<<CRLF>>
#00300FDo take care not to appear suspicious,<<CRLF>>however.<<CRLF>>
#00404FThis is...awful...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FCalilica...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FFortunately, it appears none of the resi-<<CRLF>>dences were harmed. Every blast looks<<CRLF>>to have been directed at the roads.
#00101F...So they were just warning shots?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FCome on, Adol, let's get to Calilica's<<CRLF>>house. Be careful, though, the attackers<<CRLF>>might still be around.
#00202FMasks?! No...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00302FAre these the same masked invaders as<<CRLF>>the ones you spoke of, Karna?<<CRLF>>
#00201FI don't know. The masks look different,<<CRLF>>but...<<CRLF>>
#00101FPretty sure that's Romun Army regalia<<CRLF>>they're wearing.<<CRLF>>
#00401FSo that really was Romun cannon fire,<<CRLF>>then?<<CRLF>>
#00404FBut why?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FNo response here, either. Just like in<<CRLF>>Comodo. This isn't looking good...<<CRLF>>
#00102F#00086VUgh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402F*huff* *huff*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FTheir strength... Their reaction speeds...<<CRLF>>It's exactly the same as in Comodo. It's<<CRLF>>like they aren't even human...
#00300FIf they are soldiers from your Romun Army,<<CRLF>>that would imply they are well-trained even<<CRLF>>without the power of the masks.
#00300FI am uncertain how long we can stand our<<CRLF>>ground against a foe this powerful.<<CRLF>>
#00300FI believe we may be out of options...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Stand down.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FIsn't that...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who are you?
We met in Casnan, right?
#00101FWe met him in Casnan, didn't we? Think<<CRLF>>he said his name was Gruda or something.<<CRLF>>He came from Romn.
#00101FYeah, he said his name's Gruda and he's<<CRLF>>in charge of the Romun Army.<<CRLF>>
#0MAdol Christin. Haha. Fancy meeting you here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MAllow me to extend my deepest gratitude for<<CRLF>>guiding us to Highland.<<CRLF>>
What do you mean?
Why would you do this?
#10204FThanks to your discovery of the Under-<<CRLF>>ground Ruins, we were able to advance<<CRLF>>our plans well ahead of schedule.
#00202F...Plans?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWas having Adol make a map of the<<CRLF>>forest part of those plans?<<CRLF>>
#10203FHaha. Perhaps! I'll leave that for you to<<CRLF>>determine.<<CRLF>>
#10200FI am, after all, under no obligation to<<CRLF>>discuss my actions with you.<<CRLF>>
#00300FYou mobilized quickly, considering we<<CRLF>>only just got here recently ourselves. I<<CRLF>>take it you are...well-informed.
#00402FA-are you after Lord Eldeel's tower?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FAh...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10206F...Haha. The knowledge of the Sanctuary<<CRLF>>is great indeed, but represents only the<<CRLF>>tiniest footnote in our grand scheme.
#10200FOur true objective lies even deeper in the<<CRLF>>forest...<<CRLF>>
#00408FDeeper?! No, you can't mean...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10204FBehold! The ancient tower falls silent!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10204FThe rains which have fallen for hundreds<<CRLF>>of years cease at last, and night gives<<CRLF>>way to dawn!
#00408FThe sky! It...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408F#00465VNo... No!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402FYou...<<CRLF>>What did you do to Lord Eldeel's tower?!<<CRLF>>
#2E#833cCan't you tell just by looking? We disabled<<CRLF>>it, of course.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2E#833cHaha... No more pesky barrier. No more annoying<<CRLF>>thunderstorms. Full access to all, now and<<CRLF>>forevermore!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SYou!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00302F#16SWhat are you doing here?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10205FYou both have done excellent work.<<CRLF>>Bami, your experiments with the masks<<CRLF>>have proven most enlightening.
#10204FAnd Gadis, your investigation of the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands has yielded invaluable<<CRLF>>data.
#10406FHee. It's an honor to be of service.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300FHmph. 'Bout time I get some recognition!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10205FI have confirmed that the object we seek<<CRLF>>is not here.<<CRLF>>
#10201FAs such, please commence preparations<<CRLF>>for the next phase of the plan immediately.<<CRLF>>
#10300FGotcha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400FWhat should we do with the girl?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10200FLeave her be for now. She may yet prove<<CRLF>>useful.<<CRLF>>
#10406FI see. Understood.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SWait!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FExperiments? So that means the masks<<CRLF>>here are...<<CRLF>>
#10400FI'm sorry, little girl, I'm afraid I haven't<<CRLF>>the time to be playing with you right<<CRLF>>now.
#10405FTake care of them!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10201F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10206FHa... Really, now. What do you think<<CRLF>>you're doing here?<<CRLF>>
#00101F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00302FW-wait!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FGet out of the way!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Masked Man
You're too late. You should just give up now<<CRLF>>and save yourself a lot of effort...<<CRLF>>
...dear sister.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FNo... It can't be...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FRem...nos? What are you...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Remnos
#0MIt's lovely to see you again, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What are you doing here?
You're wanted back in Comodo.
#0MDo I really need to spell it out for you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MAnd I'm afraid I will continue to be, as I have<<CRLF>>no intention of returning home.<<CRLF>>
#0MI have my duties now, as Commander Remnos<<CRLF>>of the Masked Division...and to my superior, Lord<<CRLF>>Gruda.
#00202FWhat are you...saying...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F...Oh, I get it! You're still under that<<CRLF>>woman's control, aren't you?<<CRLF>>
#12020FI'm afraid not.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12026FIt is true that Bami had placed me under<<CRLF>>her power back in Comodo...<<CRLF>>
#12020FBut now I've chosen to become a member<<CRLF>>of the Masked Division by my own free will.<<CRLF>>
#00209FWh-wha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12025FDid you come all this way looking for me?<<CRLF>>To rescue me from myself, perhaps? If so,<<CRLF>>I'd suggest you just go back home now.
#12025F...Maybe Adol can talk some sense into<<CRLF>>you.<<CRLF>>
#00201FI heard the truth about you, Remnos,<<CRLF>>from Father and that woman alike.<<CRLF>>
#00201FThey told me that you're actually really<<CRLF>>strong, but hid it from me because you<<CRLF>>were afraid I'd be hurt...
#00204F...Because that's the kind of thoughtful,<<CRLF>>selfless person you are...<<CRLF>>
#12026FHaha... 'The truth'? There seems to be<<CRLF>>a great misunderstanding here.<<CRLF>>
#12015FI just didn't care about hunting or fighting<<CRLF>>enough to give it my all. Nothing more.<<CRLF>>
#00202FNo...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FThis forest holds a secret beyond<<CRLF>>imagination.<<CRLF>>
#12020FA secret I want to know. I want to know<<CRLF>>what happened here in ancient times.<<CRLF>>
#00401F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FLord Gruda modeled these after the 'Mask<<CRLF>>of the Sun' that appears in ancient legends,<<CRLF>>you know.
#12025FWhat Bami was doing in Comodo was<<CRLF>>testing out some of the prototypes.<<CRLF>>
#12020FBut my lord's true objective here is much<<CRLF>>greater and more noble than you can<<CRLF>>possibly imagine.
#12020FI must see it fulfilled...and bear witness<<CRLF>>to the results of his glorious vision.<<CRLF>>
#12015FIt's a much more worthwhile pursuit than<<CRLF>>wasting my life away in a backwoods<<CRLF>>village like Comodo.
#00205F...Okay. I think I understand.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FBut that's all the more reason I'm going<<CRLF>>to have to drag you back home kicking and<<CRLF>>screaming!
#12021F...What?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FI don't want to believe it, but maybe you<<CRLF>>are telling the truth. Maybe life in Comodo<<CRLF>>has been unfulfilling for you. It sucks.
#00201FBut I can't sit by and watch you hurt<<CRLF>>people like this. And I can't bear to see you<<CRLF>>rely on some mask to get your way!
#12021F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205FWhen the younger brother starts walking<<CRLF>>a dangerous path like this, it's his older<<CRLF>>sister's job to put him right again!
#00202FSo like it or not, you're coming home with<<CRLF>>me, Remnos!<<CRLF>>
#12025FOh dear... This conversation isn't going<<CRLF>>anywhere.<<CRLF>>
#12020FI'm surprised you can be so confident in<<CRLF>>the face of such overwhelming power.<<CRLF>>
#00201F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12025FThis is where we part ways.<<CRLF>>...Keep them occupied while I take my<<CRLF>>leave.
#00101FYeah, they should be heading your way<<CRLF>>now.<<CRLF>>
#00101FJust pass that on...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FWhat? I know, I know, you don't have to<<CRLF>>keep telling me!<<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah...yeah...all right, then. Good luck.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F#00172V*sigh*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FLooks like I can't delay this any longer...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...So that's about the gist of it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWhat should we do now, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Chase after Gruda
Search for Eldeel
#00101FYeah, I'm worried about that Mask of the<<CRLF>>Sun they're looking for. Reeeally doesn't<<CRLF>>sound like something they should have.
#00101FYeah, getting your memories back is top<<CRLF>>priority, so going after Eldeel makes sense.<<CRLF>>
#14200FWhatever you decide to do, I'd suggest<<CRLF>>that you cross the Sanctuary and journey<<CRLF>>deeper into the forest.
#00300FWhat lies beyond the Sanctuary?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FA place called the Ashen Forest.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FWithin it sits a settlement where the<<CRLF>>descendants of those who crossed the<<CRLF>>distant oceans with Lord Eldeel live.
#14200FIt is known as the 'Village of the Wise.'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FVillage of the Wise?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14204FUnlike the other people Lord Eldeel brought<<CRLF>>here, it's said they've chosen to live in<<CRLF>>isolation. No one is certain why, however.
#14200FBut they may know something about the<<CRLF>>Mask of the Sun, as well as Lord Eldeel's...<<CRLF>>changes.
#00105FSounds like it'd be worth a visit, then, for<<CRLF>>sure. Uh, and...not to change the subject,<<CRLF>>but...
#00112FWhy is Calilica standing here, all packed<<CRLF>>up and looking like she's ready to leave?<<CRLF>>
#00411FWhat a silly question! I'm worried about<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel too, you know. And Leeza!<<CRLF>>
#14200FAdol, I would ask that you please take<<CRLF>>Calilica with you on your journey.<<CRLF>>
#14200FWhatever happens as a result of this<<CRLF>>current crisis, I feel it will have reper-<<CRLF>>cussions throughout the land.
#14200FAnd traveling will give Calilica a good<<CRLF>>opportunity to decide what path she<<CRLF>>should walk from this time forward.
#00404FGrandfather...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FFurthermore...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FIf you are journeying to the Village of the<<CRLF>>Wise, it may be helpful to have someone<<CRLF>>from Highland with you.
We'll take good care of her.
Happy to have you with us, Calilica.
#14201FIt will be a bit lonely here without her, <<CRLF>>but I trust she'll be safe in your company.<<CRLF>>
#00400FThe pleasure is all mine, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00306FThe matter is settled, then.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FNice to have you with us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403F#00456V#16SThank you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FAh, yes, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FPlease take this as well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FOh!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FIt will allow you to warp to any of the<<CRLF>>monuments you've touched in the entirety<<CRLF>>of the forest, no matter where you are.
#14200FThis would normally be given to Apostles<<CRLF>>only, but I believe in the importance of<<CRLF>>your mission. It will serve you well.
#00109FSo we don't have to go find the nearest<<CRLF>>monolith whenever we wanna warp?<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat sounds incredibly useful! Thanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14203FNow...take care out there, all of you.<<CRLF>>And best of luck!<<CRLF>>
#4CCalilica rejoined the party.
#4CYou can now accept quests in Highland.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Have you come to sell me some silver ingots?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... Looks like you brought the goods.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So how about ten thousand gold for three of<<CRLF>>them?<<CRLF>>
Sell for 10000 Gold
More!
All right, it's a deal.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I look forward to doing business with you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Purchasing Silver'!
Well, you're a much smarter trader than you<<CRLF>>look.<<CRLF>>
But I haven't worked in this business for as<<CRLF>>long as I have just to be taken in now! How<<CRLF>>about...
...I throw in a Honey Potion along with the<<CRLF>>gold?<<CRLF>>
Deal!
What else you got?
All right, it's a deal.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I look forward to doing business with you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Purchasing Silver'!
Hmm...Honey Potion not enough of a bonus for<<CRLF>>you? Well, that's fair.<<CRLF>>
How about a Bitter Potion instead?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Deal!
You can do better than that.
All right, it's a deal.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I look forward to doing business with you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Purchasing Silver'!
You do drive a hard bargain, I'll give you that!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How about some Soft Fur, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Deal!
Try again.
All right, it's a deal.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I look forward to doing business with you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Purchasing Silver'!
Even that's not good enough for you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well then, how about...I know, how about<<CRLF>>a Fierce Beast's Claw?<<CRLF>>
Deal!
Keep 'em coming.
All right, it's a deal.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I look forward to doing business with you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Purchasing Silver'!
Hah, you're one tough customer.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How about...ah, a Hammer Beak! I don't even<<CRLF>>sell those in my shop. It's a pretty good trade!<<CRLF>>
Deal!
Not good enough.
All right, it's a deal.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heh. My, my, my. You are quite the spirited<<CRLF>>young go-getter, aren't you?<<CRLF>>
It would be a pleasure to do business with you<<CRLF>>again.<<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Purchasing Silver'!
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* Well, I've compromised as much as<<CRLF>>I'm able, and if that's not good enough for<<CRLF>>you, I can tell I'm just wasting my time here.
I'll just have to buy my silver ingots from<<CRLF>>someone else, I suppose.<<CRLF>>
It's a shame, but some transactions just<<CRLF>>aren't meant to happen. Sorry we couldn't<<CRLF>>work out a deal!
#3CFailed the quest 'Purchasing Silver'...
#00400FWe saw your quest on the board,<<CRLF>>Cordelia.<<CRLF>>
Ah, Calilica! I see the red-headed traveler is<<CRLF>>with you, too.<<CRLF>>
Do you, um...believe in ghosts?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00405FI don't usually believe in those things,<<CRLF>>no. But there's been a lot of weird crap<<CRLF>>lately, so...anything's possible!
#00401FWhy? What exactly happened in the<<CRLF>>graveyard?<<CRLF>>
Well, at first I thought I was just imagining<<CRLF>>things...<<CRLF>>
But when I listened carefully in one part of<<CRLF>>the graveyard, I could hear a faint voice.<<CRLF>>
And it sounded like it was coming from beneath<<CRLF>>the ground.<<CRLF>>
It was like a groan, or a moan, or something<<CRLF>>like that.<<CRLF>>
Whatever it was, it sure didn't sound like<<CRLF>>anything from this world.<<CRLF>>
It must have been...a cry from beyond...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Don't you agree, Mr. Tiddles?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Myaaao!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00412FHmm...I see. I think I might have an idea<<CRLF>>what's going on.<<CRLF>>
Really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00405FI can't be quite sure what you mean by<<CRLF>>it not sounding like anything from this<<CRLF>>world...
#00412FBut I'm guessing it could've been a wild<<CRLF>>beast, right?<<CRLF>>
Er, well, not re--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00405FAnd as for it coming from beneath the<<CRLF>>ground...<<CRLF>>
#00400F...Well, think about what's under that<<CRLF>>graveyard. You know what I'm getting at,<<CRLF>>right, Adol?
The Underground Ruins
Hell
#00400FThat's right!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00405FNot that I expected you to get it wrong...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401F...Are you serious? You have to be<<CRLF>>joking. Please tell me you're joking.<<CRLF>>
#00401FI'm talking about the Underground Ruins<<CRLF>>you guys traveled through to get here!<<CRLF>>Sheesh!
#00405FWhatever. Cordelia, you need to grow up<<CRLF>>and stop messing around.<<CRLF>>
#00405FEveryone in Highland knows about that<<CRLF>>place, so I'm sure you could have worked<<CRLF>>out where the sound originated from.
#00401FSo really, you just put out this request to<<CRLF>>try and mess with us, didn't you?<<CRLF>>
Hahaha... Okay, you got me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You could've at least played along a little bit,<<CRLF>>though.<<CRLF>>
#00405F*sigh* ...I suppose that means this<<CRLF>>request is a monster extermination.<<CRLF>>
#00401FThe fact you could hear it at all means<<CRLF>>it must be fairly close to the surface, and<<CRLF>>that isn't something we can overlook.
#00400FSo let's go and finish this up quickly,<<CRLF>>Adol.<<CRLF>>
Hahaha... Thanks.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So then, Calilica, did you find any wild beasts?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWe did. Although they were more<<CRLF>>monster than they were animal.<<CRLF>>
#00400FThey'd organized into a small group. It<<CRLF>>was a little unsettling to see, actually!<<CRLF>>
Huh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Maybe now that the barrier is gone, they decided<<CRLF>>it would be a good opportunity to try and invade<<CRLF>>Highland...
Pff, as if!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What's with that look on your faces? Did you<<CRLF>>actually think I was serious?!<<CRLF>>
#00404FW-well, I'm sure it was just my<<CRLF>>imagination...<<CRLF>>
Y-yeah, no doubt!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
S-say, I'm sorry if I caused any trouble for<<CRLF>>you.<<CRLF>>
Please take this, along with my apologies.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Have you come to sell me some silver ingots?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but...<<CRLF>>you don't seem to have any with you!<<CRLF>>
Please let me know when you've brought the<<CRLF>>goods.<<CRLF>>
I wonder what's happened to Lord Eldeel...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I understand he's ill, but it would be<<CRLF>>reassuring just to hear about it from him<<CRLF>>directly, rather than through Leeza.
The Romuns stationed here seem to be behaving<<CRLF>>reasonably.<<CRLF>>
I can imagine that's a result of Griselda's<<CRLF>>orders, but it's still reassuring to know<<CRLF>>that the Romuns have some good in them.
I wonder what's going to happen to this town<<CRLF>>now.<<CRLF>>
Though I'm actually more worried about Lord<<CRLF>>Eldeel, since he still seems to be suffering<<CRLF>>from that illness...
There are so many things to worry about at the<<CRLF>>moment, I can barely get to sleep at night!<<CRLF>>
I never thought I'd see the day Romun soldiers<<CRLF>>would appear in this town.<<CRLF>>
And on top of that, the mayor says Lord Eldeel<<CRLF>>has taken ill.<<CRLF>>
It's like a nightmare turned real!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Good evening to you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The sun's gone down, but I'm not going to be<<CRLF>>closing up shop for a while longer.<<CRLF>>

Once you get to know them, you start realizing<<CRLF>>that individual soldiers are generally good<<CRLF>>people.
But as soon as they come together as an army,<<CRLF>>they can do the most inhumane things...<<CRLF>>
This town has gotten a little too lively lately.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Interacting with people from the outside isn't<<CRLF>>always bad, but I think we've had our fill at<<CRLF>>this point. I mean, enough is enough...
More visitors arrived here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It doesn't seem like this town's ever going to<<CRLF>>go back to the way it used to be.<<CRLF>>
Whether I trust them or not, just having<<CRLF>>soldiers stationed all over town makes it<<CRLF>>awfully hard to relax.
Hello, and welcome to Highland.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Make yourself at home here. I'm sure you've<<CRLF>>had a long journey.<<CRLF>>
Governor General Griselda seems to be com-<<CRLF>>pletely serious about trying to keep Romn from<<CRLF>>finding out about this town.
I really hope she succeeds, and I'm grateful for<<CRLF>>the effort, but...I still can't help worrying.<<CRLF>>
You know, those two explorers managed to slip<<CRLF>>by the Romuns.<<CRLF>>
The Romun guards seem fairly competent, too,<<CRLF>>so that duo must be a lot stronger than they<<CRLF>>looked.
It seems two explorers have arrived from<<CRLF>>Casnan. I wonder what the Romuns will do with<<CRLF>>them.
Who would've thought the Romuns could ever<<CRLF>>come attack us?<<CRLF>>
What's going to happen to us now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol, you really gave me the shock of my life<<CRLF>>yesterday.<<CRLF>>
I genuinely thought I'd seen a ghost!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yeah. But I mean, they probably aren't stupid<<CRLF>>back in Romn, so they still might suspect<<CRLF>>something!
It is enough to make a person feel uneasy,<<CRLF>>that's for sure.<<CRLF>>
Seems that way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Maybe appearing weaker than they are was their<<CRLF>>plan all along, to get everyone to lower their<<CRLF>>guard.
Good question.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But we can't have those two taking information<<CRLF>>about Highland away with them...<<CRLF>>
And Lord Eldeel falling ill on top of that...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Part of me still can't believe any of this<<CRLF>>is really happening!<<CRLF>>
I couldn't believe my eyes either.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I thought you had a twin brother or something!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We haven't heard a thing about Lord Eldeel's<<CRLF>>health in quite a while. I'm really starting<<CRLF>>to get worried.
I've tried asking the mayor, but he always<<CRLF>>avoids answering any of my questions. But<<CRLF>>I really just want to know what's going on!
Kids just don't have a care in the world.<<CRLF>>I can't help but envy how they can be so<<CRLF>>carefree, even during times like these.
Still, how long are those three going to keep<<CRLF>>fighting?!<<CRLF>>
It sure seems a lot more boisterous around here<<CRLF>>lately, what with the two explorers and the<<CRLF>>Romuns showing up.
It's really forcing us to think about the future<<CRLF>>of this town.<<CRLF>>
I doubt a single soul ever imagined the Romun<<CRLF>>Army was even capable of attacking Highland.<<CRLF>>
How and why did things come to this point?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're the first people I've known to make it<<CRLF>>this far on your own.<<CRLF>>
But until the mayor's decided what should be<<CRLF>>done about the problems your return has created,<<CRLF>>we do ask for your cooperation.
If anything bad were to happen, there wouldn't<<CRLF>>be words enough in existence to apologize to<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel.

But I'm not gonna give up!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Joel, it's now or never!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Which of us do you like more?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Me and Joel are in love!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He confessed to me the other day!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Joel and me are tied together by a red string of<<CRLF>>fate!<<CRLF>>
That's an indisputable fact!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Joel's gonna be a scholar with me! We'll have<<CRLF>>a scholar's wedding and make scholar babies!<<CRLF>>
And that's an undeniable fact!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* Joel's so indecisive.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Joel, what's this all about?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You can't like both of us! You're not allowed to<<CRLF>>be a two-timer!<<CRLF>>
That's a lie! Joel's in love with me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He told me himself the other day!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Amy, just because you're from a family of<<CRLF>>scholars doesn't mean you can force Joel to be<<CRLF>>one too!
You're so arrogant!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I told you, Joel's going to be a tailor with me!<<CRLF>>We'll have a tailor's wedding and make tailor<<CRLF>>babies!
He's got no other choice!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Joel, have you made up your mind?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Today, you're gonna have to pick one of us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Um... Well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I-I know!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
How about I play with you on alternate days?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Like if I play with Amy today, then I'll play<<CRLF>>with Jill tomorrow...<<CRLF>>
Amy and Jill
*glare*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...S-sorry...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder what Commander Leo and his men are<<CRLF>>doing right now.<<CRLF>>
I hope they didn't let the Masked Division get<<CRLF>>the better of them...<<CRLF>>
I accidentally let those two explorers pass<<CRLF>>through.<<CRLF>>
Most of the soldiers here pursued them, but<<CRLF>>somehow, they still managed to get away.<<CRLF>>
We underestimated them because they seemed<<CRLF>>like idiots, but they're shockingly quick on their<<CRLF>>feet.
We underestimated those two explorers<<CRLF>>because they seemed like idiots, but they're<<CRLF>>shockingly quick on their feet.
I'd like to believe I could've stopped them if<<CRLF>>I hadn't let my guard down, but what's done is<<CRLF>>done.
I've been ordered not to let any explorers from<<CRLF>>Casnan pass here.<<CRLF>>
You and your companions are the only exceptions,<<CRLF>>but do try to avoid being noticed if you should<<CRLF>>come or go through this checkpoint.
Oh, it's you. We've been ordered to allow you<<CRLF>>and your companions to pass.<<CRLF>>
Just do your best not to end up dead, okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
More people here have been saying hello to me<<CRLF>>lately.<<CRLF>>
Everyone has this gloomy, distrustful look in<<CRLF>>their eyes. Not that I blame them...<<CRLF>>
But the fact that they're willing to talk to me<<CRLF>>makes me very happy, and shows that I'm doing<<CRLF>>my job the right way.
The air here is so clean...but it's also really<<CRLF>>thin.<<CRLF>>
Makes it a little hard to breathe sometimes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mm, looks like drinking alcohol's the only<<CRLF>>source of pleasure around here.<<CRLF>>
...Although since we're bothering the locals<<CRLF>>just with our mere presence, I guess I shouldn't<<CRLF>>be thinking such selfish thoughts.
I've got to take this job very seriously.<<CRLF>>I'm representing Romn, after all.<<CRLF>>
Since we're bothering the locals just with our<<CRLF>>mere presence, I guess I shouldn't be thinking<<CRLF>>too hard about my leisure time.
I've got to take this job very seriously.<<CRLF>>I'm representing Romn, after all.<<CRLF>>
We're used to being seen as the bad guys.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm not going to tell you to try and understand<<CRLF>>our perspective, but it does kind of hurt when<<CRLF>>everyone just...assumes you're the enemy.
The view here is truly stunning.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't know how long we're going to be here,<<CRLF>>but I have to make sure I burn this amazing<<CRLF>>scenery into my memory before we leave.
It's really cold here. You'd expect it would<<CRLF>>be, though, considering the town is built on<<CRLF>>such high ground.
I can't wait for the end of my shift so I can go<<CRLF>>and have some hot soup.<<CRLF>>
Two explorers arrived here a little while ago.<<CRLF>>We took them into custody right away, but it<<CRLF>>was definitely a shock.
Supposedly, they came through the Underground<<CRLF>>Ruins, but I don't know how they managed to<<CRLF>>get through our patrols.
The Masked Division was acting on unofficial<<CRLF>>orders, but it still pains me to think of the<<CRLF>>suffering caused here in the name of Romn.
I can't say if they'll ever really trust us<<CRLF>>after something like that. All I can do is try<<CRLF>>to earn their trust through my actions.
Oh, Adol, are you heading out?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're welcome to leave, but do be careful<<CRLF>>out there.<<CRLF>>
We've already had to make a grave for you<<CRLF>>once, and would hate to do it again. Much<<CRLF>>less make more of them for your friends...

We've already had to make a grave for you<<CRLF>>once, and would hate to do it again. Much<<CRLF>>less make more of them for your friends...
#4CThey really don't want anyone leaving town through this exit. It<<CRLF>>would probably be best to respect their wishes.<<CRLF>>
#4CIt's best not to leave town without the others.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThat girl seems to have entered the chapel...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe Sanctuary of Storms can be found beyond the northern exit,<<CRLF>>not here.<<CRLF>>
#00405FWhere are you going? I'm supposed to<<CRLF>>be showing you around the town.<<CRLF>>
#00412FYou might've lost your memories, but I<<CRLF>>have a feeling we still need to keep an<<CRLF>>eye on you at all times...
#00412FCome, now, I haven't finished your tour<<CRLF>>yet. Honestly, I'm doing all of this for you,<<CRLF>>you know!
#4CIt's best not to leave town without the others.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FHey, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FHow about we stop by at that shop<<CRLF>>before we leave town? Philemon's<<CRLF>>Workshop, was it?
#00100FYeah, that was the one that looked like<<CRLF>>it dealt with machines.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWe might be able to stock up on supplies<<CRLF>>there.<<CRLF>>
#00300FIt would be wise to see what they have<<CRLF>>to offer, then, before we depart.<<CRLF>>
#4CIt seems like it would be best to stop by at Philemon's Workshop<<CRLF>>before leaving town.<<CRLF>>
#4CThere's a strange creature hiding here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Meeheehee! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWh-whoa! It couldn't be...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Meeeheee!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What was that?
Did it run away?
#00401FIt might have been a creature called<<CRLF>>'Mishy.' I've heard of it once before.<<CRLF>>
#00411FIt's supposed to be extremely shy,<<CRLF>>always appearing in weird places.<<CRLF>>It brings good luck to those who find it.
#00411F...For the life of me, though, I can't<<CRLF>>remember where I heard about it.<<CRLF>>
#00400FEither way, if we get a chance, it might<<CRLF>>be worth trying to track the little guy<<CRLF>>down.
#00401FIt seems to have, yeah.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

<< mp4202.JSON_TEXT 577 >>
Oh, good to see you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Did you see my request on the board?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWe did.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FIt's about our magic artifacts, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FMeaning...you're going to tell them<<CRLF>>about it, aren't you?<<CRLF>>
#00400FErr... Is there something you wanted us<<CRLF>>to do?<<CRLF>>
There is, yes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Although it's less a request and more a<<CRLF>>discussion. I have something I'd like to<<CRLF>>address with you about your artifacts.
#00405FSomething you'd like to address, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400F...This is about that service of yours, isn't<<CRLF>>it? Are you going to tell them, then?<<CRLF>>
Haha. I am indeed.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Oh, sorry, Adol. You probably have no idea<<CRLF>>what we're talking about.<<CRLF>>
Now that the mayor has accepted you, I'm free<<CRLF>>to discuss this with you. This workshop here<<CRLF>>is also known as the Artifact Workshop.
And as the name implies, I handle special items<<CRLF>>called 'artifacts' here.<<CRLF>>
#00411FThat's what we call complex magically-<<CRLF>>imbued objects. Like my mace, and the<<CRLF>>street lights in this town.
#00400FBasically, anything operated using mystical<<CRLF>>energy rather than oil, coal or other more<<CRLF>>physical forms of power.
Indeed. And all of the artifacts in this<<CRLF>>town were presented to us by Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
In general, only Apostles and apprentice<<CRLF>>Apostles are allowed to possess them for<<CRLF>>their own personal use.
But it seems you already have a few in your<<CRLF>>possession as well, Adol.<<CRLF>>
I imagine they, too, must originate from the<<CRLF>>same source as the ones here.<<CRLF>>
Regardless, the reason I have summoned you here<<CRLF>>today is to offer my services. I can unleash the<<CRLF>>full potential of your artifacts.
Unleash their full potential?
How?
Indeed. Artifacts contain essentially limitless<<CRLF>>potential.<<CRLF>>
However, unless that potential has specifically<<CRLF>>been unleashed, most artifacts only utilize a<<CRLF>>small portion of it.
And that's where my services come in. I can<<CRLF>>release the true potential of any artifacts you<<CRLF>>find.
But to do so, I'll need power stones: gems<<CRLF>>containing magical power, few of which still<<CRLF>>remain in existence.
If you bring me gems, I can boost the<<CRLF>>performance of your artifacts substantially.<<CRLF>>

I see...
I'm a bit confused.
#00412FDid you really understand all of that,<<CRLF>>Adol?<<CRLF>>
#00405FEven if you didn't, I'm sure you will after<<CRLF>>you see it for yourself.<<CRLF>>
#00400FWould you be able to show us, Philemon?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FHeh. Glad to see you're honest, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FI think you'll understand better when<<CRLF>>you've had some experience actually<<CRLF>>doing it.
#00400FWould you be able to show us, Philemon?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'd love to, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
While I have the facilities and technology here,<<CRLF>>I'm a bit short on materials at the moment.<<CRLF>>
So can I ask you to bring me some gems?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404F*sigh* I knew this wouldn't be as simple<<CRLF>>as it sounded.<<CRLF>>
#00400FWhat is it you need?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... How about I unleash the power of your<<CRLF>>'Dwarf Bracelet' first?<<CRLF>>
For that, I'll need one Emerald and one Topaz.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FOne Emerald and one Topaz, huh? Those<<CRLF>>aren't going to come cheap.<<CRLF>>
#00405FBut, if that's what you need, that's what<<CRLF>>you need!<<CRLF>>
#00400FLet's go see if we can track down those<<CRLF>>gems, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#3CThe quest 'Unleashing Artifacts' has been\nadded to your journal.
#00400FHere you go, Philemon. We've brought<<CRLF>>the gems you requested.<<CRLF>>
Thank you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Guess I'll get started, then!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Well, looks like the process was successful.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FSo, what's different about it now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FWill it allow us to become even smaller<<CRLF>>or something?<<CRLF>>
No, it doesn't work that way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Instead, you can now maintain your physical<<CRLF>>strength when using the artifact.<<CRLF>>
So even when you're miniaturized, you can still<<CRLF>>fight as you would normally.<<CRLF>>
#00400FI see. Useful, if not a little boring.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*cough* Boring?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Boring or not, that's the general gist of<<CRLF>>what I can do for you here.<<CRLF>>
Oh, and...Timali?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yes, Gramps?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol and his friends are going to be regular<<CRLF>>customers here from now on.<<CRLF>>
So see to them if they need anything.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mm. All right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, do feel free to come back here if<<CRLF>>you need our services again.<<CRLF>>
When you want one of your artifacts<<CRLF>>unleashed, just talk to Timali.<<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Unleashing Artifacts'!
#4CYou can now use Philemon's Workshop!
Hello, Calilica!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FOh, hello, Ethan.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWe saw your request on the board.<<CRLF>>What's this about a signature book?<<CRLF>>
Okay, let me explain.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
See, I was given this notebook by my dad.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't know why, but it's full of names. Well,<<CRLF>>almost full, but I'll get to that part in a second.<<CRLF>>
I've been trying to fill it the rest of the<<CRLF>>way by talking to different people and<<CRLF>>asking them to sign their names in it.
#00400FHmm. That's a rather peculiar pastime.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heh, I know. But it's kinda fun!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There's a page for every letter of the alphabet,<<CRLF>>and each page has space for a signature from<<CRLF>>someone whose name starts with that letter.
Unfortunately, there are three pages I haven't<<CRLF>>been able to fill yet.<<CRLF>>
#00400FAnd what letters do those pages start<<CRLF>>with?<<CRLF>>
One's 'Q', one's 'U' and one's 'Z'.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've spoken to lots and lots of people, but<<CRLF>>I haven't encountered anyone to sign any of<<CRLF>>those particular pages.
I'm thinking there just AREN'T any people whose<<CRLF>>names begin with those letters here in Highland.<<CRLF>>
And since I'm out of local options, I figured<<CRLF>>I'd try and look for some outside help.<<CRLF>>
#00405FYeah, I guess there are only so many<<CRLF>>people you can ask here...<<CRLF>>
Exactly.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But if you guys are willing to help, I'll<<CRLF>>bet I can get this finished in no time!<<CRLF>>
After all, there's a whole big world out there,<<CRLF>>and you're making a point of exploring it bit<<CRLF>>by bit, right? It's a perfect match!
#00411FThat's certainly true enough.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWhat do you think, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FIt sounds like a really interesting request.<<CRLF>>Might be fun!<<CRLF>>
#00400FSo what do you say we help Ethan get<<CRLF>>the last few signatures he needs?<<CRLF>>
Oh, have you changed your mind?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Accept
Refuse
Really? Thank you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Here's my signature book, then.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Let me know when you've got the signatures of<<CRLF>>people whose names begin with 'Q', 'U' and 'Z'.<<CRLF>>
I really hope you can finish it for me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Y-you're not interested in helping out?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Okay, then...but if you change your mind,<<CRLF>>I'll be right here.<<CRLF>>
Y-you still won't help?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Okay, then...but if you change your mind,<<CRLF>>I'll be right here.<<CRLF>>
Wow, you actually did it! You filled the<<CRLF>>last few pages!<<CRLF>>
Let's see what we've got...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Interesting! I've never seen names like these<<CRLF>>before. The world really is a big place, huh?<<CRLF>>
It makes the imagination soar to think about<<CRLF>>what kinds of people these names belong to!<<CRLF>>
#00411FHeheh, doesn't it, though?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, yes, I need to give you your reward.<<CRLF>>A reward well-earned, I might add!<<CRLF>>
Here you go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll treasure this signature book forever.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you so much for your help!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

You should be honored we allow someone like<<CRLF>>you to use our services.<<CRLF>>
If the Romuns were to try and take over this<<CRLF>>workshop, we'd have to trash everything here.<<CRLF>>
The knowledge of Highland is the knowledge of<<CRLF>>the world.<<CRLF>>
We're never going to deal with Romun customers<<CRLF>>here in this workshop.<<CRLF>>
If they think they can get the knowledge of<<CRLF>>Highland that easily, they've got another thing<<CRLF>>coming!
Just remembering my great-uncle's skill as a<<CRLF>>craftsman makes me swoon.<<CRLF>>
If he were slimmer, I'd probably have fallen for<<CRLF>>him, family or no!<<CRLF>>
My great-uncle disappeared one day into the<<CRLF>>Sanctuary, saying he wanted to 'find even<<CRLF>>greater mysteries.'
...He was suave like that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Let me know when you've found an Emerald<<CRLF>>and a Topaz.<<CRLF>>

Lord Eldeel's illness, the Romun Army...<<CRLF>>There seems to be no end of things to worry<<CRLF>>about these days.
...But more than anything, I'm worried about<<CRLF>>Gazock.<<CRLF>>
I hope he's all right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
He said he's used to exploring the forest,<<CRLF>>but I can't help feeling a bit concerned.<<CRLF>>
He's always been a curious one, ever since he<<CRLF>>was younger.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure he's been through a lot since leaving<<CRLF>>here, but I was so glad to see him alive and<<CRLF>>well...
It seems Gazock's desire to know more about<<CRLF>>the Kingdom of Celceta is greater than his love<<CRLF>>for his hometown.
In other words, he hasn't changed a bit!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I never dreamed I'd be able to see Gazock alive<<CRLF>>again.<<CRLF>>
There's nothing in the world that could make<<CRLF>>me happier than this!<<CRLF>>
Don't be afraid to look around here as<<CRLF>>much as you'd like.<<CRLF>>
I hope you find something to trigger your<<CRLF>>memory.<<CRLF>>
What would happen if Romn were to find out<<CRLF>>about this town?<<CRLF>>
I really don't want there to be a war...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Rumor has it those two explorers ran off<<CRLF>>somewhere.<<CRLF>>
I wanted to talk to them, too! It's very<<CRLF>>disappointing.<<CRLF>>
I was expecting the Romuns to be all arrogant<<CRLF>>and full of themselves, but they're actually<<CRLF>>quite polite.
They give off a different impression entirely<<CRLF>>from those other soldiers, the...masked ones,<<CRLF>>whatever they called themselves.
As far as I know, nothing like this has ever<<CRLF>>happened before in Highland.<<CRLF>>
I'm still finding it hard to process the events<<CRLF>>we've seen unfold here.<<CRLF>>
I was really surprised when I heard you were<<CRLF>>still alive.<<CRLF>>
And not only that, you were able to make it<<CRLF>>back here with your friends! You are truly<<CRLF>>a special individual, Adol Christin.
What's going to happen to us now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We're not going to be driven out, are we?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The town's so lively lately, with all manner of<<CRLF>>visitors from the outside!<<CRLF>>
It's fun just watching them.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All the armored soldiers in town are<<CRLF>>surprisingly nice.<<CRLF>>
They're not much like the Romuns we heard<<CRLF>>about in class.<<CRLF>>
Those people in armor came from Romn, right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I know all about Romn! There are lots of violent<<CRLF>>people there, so I should probably stay away<<CRLF>>from them.
Are you a zombie?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I know all about zombies! Sometimes when<<CRLF>>people die, they keep moving around and<<CRLF>>they're called zombies.
So the Governor General intends to try<<CRLF>>keeping this town a secret from Romn?<<CRLF>>
I wonder if she'll really be able to succeed...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Apparently the Romuns let those two explorers<<CRLF>>escape.<<CRLF>>
What were they doing? They were supposed to<<CRLF>>be guarding them!<<CRLF>>
With all that's happened lately, there's little<<CRLF>>point in keeping an eye on the river anymore.<<CRLF>>
All these explorers knocking on our doors...<<CRLF>>I just hope they don't cause any trouble!<<CRLF>>
I never imagined the day would come that we'd<<CRLF>>lose the protection of the Sanctuary of Storms.<<CRLF>>
I wonder what's going to happen to this town<<CRLF>>now...<<CRLF>>
Oh, it's you, Calilica. I see Adol and his<<CRLF>>friends are with you, too.<<CRLF>>
Have you come to ask me something?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FYeah, we have.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FOh, but first, I should introduce you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FThis is Werner. He's responsible for<<CRLF>>observing the river.<<CRLF>>
#00109FObserving the river? Surprised there's a<<CRLF>>job like that here.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo, you seen anything strange around the<<CRLF>>river lately?<<CRLF>>
Well, yes, actually.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Not long ago, I saw two strangely-dressed<<CRLF>>individuals, a man and a woman, on the opposite<<CRLF>>shore.
#00109FHmm... Can you describe them at all?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The woman was...let's just say 'lightly<<CRLF>>dressed,' and had long, purple hair.<<CRLF>>
And the man was enormous, clad in obscenely<<CRLF>>heavy-looking armor.<<CRLF>>
I remember them well because they were such<<CRLF>>an odd combination. Like a study in opposites!<<CRLF>>
#00208FThat sounds like...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FThat man must have been the beast<<CRLF>>tamer we encountered.<<CRLF>>
#00201FYeah. And the woman must be that<<CRLF>>magician.<<CRLF>>
#00101FSo those two're allies? Sure wouldn't<<CRLF>>have guessed that...<<CRLF>>
Oh, you've met them yourselves?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Unfortunately, all I could confirm is that the<<CRLF>>two of them were together.<<CRLF>>
They were on the opposite shore, after all, so<<CRLF>>I couldn't hear what they were talking about,<<CRLF>>nor confirm exactly what they were doing.
#00300FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FStill, at least now we know they're<<CRLF>>connected in some way.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThat's pretty significant on its own.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThanks for the information!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, it was nothing.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm happy to have helped.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FThanks a bunch!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All I could confirm is that one was a man and<<CRLF>>one was a woman, and they were both dressed<<CRLF>>peculiarly. Nothing more.
I'm glad to hear that information is useful<<CRLF>>to you.<<CRLF>>
If the Romuns started trying to develop the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands, we probably wouldn't be able<<CRLF>>to remain here any longer.
But where would we go?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if the explorers who escaped are<<CRLF>>heading deeper into the forest to look for<<CRLF>>relics from the Kingdom of Celceta...
The two of them seemed to have an abundance<<CRLF>>of energy, that's for sure!<<CRLF>>
They must be pretty skilled explorers to evade<<CRLF>>the Romuns and make it this far.<<CRLF>>
Or maybe the Romuns are just...extremely<<CRLF>>stupid? Either way, it's the talk of the town.<<CRLF>>
Regardless of why they're here, it's hard to<<CRLF>>relax with Romun soldiers around.<<CRLF>>
That attack on the town yesterday...<<CRLF>>It was like a living nightmare.<<CRLF>>
More people here are worrying about the<<CRLF>>future of this town by the day.<<CRLF>>
I'd like to ease their worries, but honestly,<<CRLF>>we don't really know what's going to happen<<CRLF>>either.
When you're indoors, it's really easy to forget<<CRLF>>you're in the middle of the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
But when you're outside, it hits you like a ton<<CRLF>>of bricks!<<CRLF>>
Aah... This town really is relaxing.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I miss the bustle of Romn a little, but I think<<CRLF>>I might actually be better suited to a place<<CRLF>>like this.
Do we look like we're slacking off?<<CRLF>>Well, we're not.<<CRLF>>
We're currently on our break, that's all!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I might be a soldier, but I'm still a person.<<CRLF>>Whenever I'm in one place for a long time,<<CRLF>>I become pretty attached to it.
I don't know what the army's going to do, but<<CRLF>>I hope everything can be resolved peacefully.<<CRLF>>
I can't believe we let those explorers get<<CRLF>>away! It's shameful.<<CRLF>>
I don't know how we can possibly make it up<<CRLF>>to Governor General Griselda.<<CRLF>>
A couple of strange-looking explorers came by<<CRLF>>here a while ago.<<CRLF>>
They're locked up in the mayor's mansion at<<CRLF>>the moment.<<CRLF>>
Man, this town really is amazing!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's so deep in the Great Forest, yet it boasts<<CRLF>>all this advanced technology... Hard to believe<<CRLF>>it's even real!
I wonder if Lord Eldeel is truly all right...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I feel as though the mayor is hiding something<<CRLF>>from us.<<CRLF>>
I hope Jill is getting along well with Joel and<<CRLF>>Amy.<<CRLF>>
Still, while I appreciate that she's thinking<<CRLF>>of inheriting the family business despite her<<CRLF>>age...
I wish she'd put a bit more effort into<<CRLF>>actually watching me work. She still has<<CRLF>>so much to learn!
I appreciate that Jill's thinking about<<CRLF>>inheriting the family business despite her<<CRLF>>age...
But I wish she'd put a bit more effort into<<CRLF>>actually watching me work. She still has<<CRLF>>so much to learn!
Even in times like these, there's still work to<<CRLF>>do.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* I think I'll try to get a bit more done<<CRLF>>before taking my break.<<CRLF>>
It doesn't seem the Romuns intend to harm us.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Still, while that might be the case now, who<<CRLF>>knows what the future will bring? We can't<<CRLF>>let our guard down, even for a moment.
Welcome, travelers.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
As you can see, this is a place where we<<CRLF>>weave fabrics and tailor clothes.<<CRLF>>
This is the role that has been passed down in<<CRLF>>my family for generations.<<CRLF>>

This continent of Europe is full of mysterious<<CRLF>>and unstudied creatures.<<CRLF>>
The more I research on the matter, the more new<<CRLF>>questions arise. Every answer leads to another<<CRLF>>pair of questions.
But that's what makes this line of study so...<<CRLF>>fascinating!<<CRLF>>
There's no end to research. Every answer just<<CRLF>>leads to another pair of questions.<<CRLF>>
But that's what makes this line of study so...<<CRLF>>fascinating!<<CRLF>>
Ulpacas and Camebulls are livestock that thrive<<CRLF>>in cold places.<<CRLF>>
So they're well-suited to living in Highland,<<CRLF>>and are growing quite strong here.<<CRLF>>
Shining Pikkards have the ability to store gold<<CRLF>>in their bodies. That's what gives them their<<CRLF>>sheen.
But what factors could possibly cause a pikkard<<CRLF>>to do such a thing? How did it even evolve that<<CRLF>>way?
I've been trying to find the answer for years,<<CRLF>>but it remains as elusive as it was the day<<CRLF>>I started.
The Romun attack was truly terrifying.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Even the livestock panicked when it happened.<<CRLF>>They must have sensed what was going on. As<<CRLF>>did I. I've never felt such dread in the air!
Hello. My name's Barton, and I study different<<CRLF>>ecosystems here in Highland.<<CRLF>>
We've met before, but as it seems you don't<<CRLF>>remember, I see no harm in reintroducing myself.<<CRLF>>
I'm currently raising rare livestock from<<CRLF>>throughout the Europan continent in this<<CRLF>>building.
Feel free to visit here anytime if you'd like to<<CRLF>>study them yourself.<<CRLF>>

The history of the Romun Empire is filled<<CRLF>>with nothing but conquest and aggression.<<CRLF>>
If they were to learn that some of Altago's<<CRLF>>technology came from Highland...<<CRLF>>
I really can't get used to dealing with those<<CRLF>>outsiders.<<CRLF>>
It's said that the King of Celceta had a number<<CRLF>>of skilled retainers who served him.<<CRLF>>
Although ever since the kingdom fell, no one<<CRLF>>knows who inherited their bloodline.<<CRLF>>
When the Kingdom of Celceta was at the height<<CRLF>>of its prosperity, it seems several other villages<<CRLF>>existed in the forest which no longer remain.
Although the kingdom was well-governed on the<<CRLF>>whole, there were numerous conflicts between<<CRLF>>these villages...but that's all we know.
I never once imagined that the Tower of<<CRLF>>Providence could ever stop working...<<CRLF>>
Is it possible to reactivate it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm really glad you're alive. We all feared the<<CRLF>>worst.<<CRLF>>
There are only dust and old dreams in here,<<CRLF>>but please make yourself at home if you can.<<CRLF>>
The history of man is a history of war. As long<<CRLF>>as humanity exists, I doubt war will ever truly<<CRLF>>disappear.
I genuinely believe that a time will come when<<CRLF>>there is no longer a need for weapons, however.<<CRLF>>
It seems like Amy's out with Joel and Jill<<CRLF>>again.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure it's difficult for Joel to have two<<CRLF>>girls after him at his age...<<CRLF>>
But for someone who's going to be the head of<<CRLF>>his family one day, it's never too early to<<CRLF>>learn how to make tough decisions.

The process of natural selection applies to<<CRLF>>nature as much as it applies to people.<<CRLF>>
But in people, it breeds hatred and resentment.<<CRLF>>Whereas in nature, it does not.<<CRLF>>
No matter how much the times may change,<<CRLF>>that alone seems to be an eternal truth.<<CRLF>>
I couldn't believe it when Mariana told me<<CRLF>>that Lord Eldeel had vanished.<<CRLF>>
If he can't complete the Rite of Summoning,<<CRLF>>what's going to happen to the world's balance?<<CRLF>>
Heh. He was so excited yesterday when he<<CRLF>>found out you were still alive.<<CRLF>>
It's a shame you don't remember meeting him,<<CRLF>>but please, do try and be his friend if you can.<<CRLF>>
Oh, Adol! It's great to see you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm so glad you're alive. Everyone here feared<<CRLF>>the worst.<<CRLF>>
There are only dust and old dreams in here,<<CRLF>>but please make yourself at home if you can.<<CRLF>>
#00109FNothing but dust and old dreams, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FA few too many books in here to make<<CRLF>>a claim like that, if you ask me!<<CRLF>>
Heh. Yes, I do have a lot.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FSimon and Betty are the descendants of<<CRLF>>scholars, and the most well-educated<<CRLF>>people in all of Highland.
#00400FWhile Lord Eldeel gives the ultimate<<CRLF>>decision on whom to invite to this town...<<CRLF>>
#00400F...he'll often ask for advice from Simon<<CRLF>>and Betty before doing so.<<CRLF>>
#00109FWow... So they're kind of like his heavenly<<CRLF>>advisers or something, then?<<CRLF>>
Oh, no, we're not quite that important.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Lord Eldeel is omnipotent and omniscient in the<<CRLF>>truest sense, you see.<<CRLF>>
But as a result of that, he doesn't always see<<CRLF>>things the same way a human would.<<CRLF>>
And that's where we come in. We provide him<<CRLF>>with a human perspective on things. Nothing<<CRLF>>more.
Frankly, it's an honor that he listens to us<<CRLF>>at all.<<CRLF>>
#00301FHmm... I see.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FHow long has this Eldeel been living in<<CRLF>>the region?<<CRLF>>
Well, I couldn't give you an exact answer, but<<CRLF>>it's been hundreds of years for sure.<<CRLF>>
I don't know if you've ever seen any, but all<<CRLF>>of the winged statues in the Great Forest are<<CRLF>>images of Lord Eldeel.
#00208FHundreds of years?! So that means he<<CRLF>>must be a really, really old man by now...<<CRLF>>
Heh. You wouldn't be able to tell if you met<<CRLF>>him. He looks and acts like he's still in his<<CRLF>>prime.
I've never heard of him falling ill before,<<CRLF>>either.<<CRLF>>
#00209FW-wow...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
His personality's a large part of why all of us<<CRLF>>here in Highland love him so much.<<CRLF>>
He's incredibly kind, and he even has a great<<CRLF>>sense of humor. Just talking with him always<<CRLF>>puts me at ease.
#00105FSounds like a pretty great guy. Er, god.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ah, I think we've probably kept you long<<CRLF>>enough now.<<CRLF>>
True. We should be letting them go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But you're welcome to come back anytime if<<CRLF>>you should ever need anything.<<CRLF>>
Calilica, I'm sure you have plenty of other<<CRLF>>places to show them, no?<<CRLF>>
#00400FYeah, I guess so. Thank you both for<<CRLF>>your time.<<CRLF>>
I'm really worried about Lord Eldeel's health.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I really hope it doesn't get any worse...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
While I'm nervous about making contact with<<CRLF>>the outside world, it's also quite exciting.<<CRLF>>
Life is simpler when you stay in familiar<<CRLF>>surroundings, but there's so little excitement<<CRLF>>to it!
I can't help but think this might be a good<<CRLF>>chance for us to start becoming more involved in<<CRLF>>the affairs of the outside world.

Oh, it's you, Adol. We got rid of your grave<<CRLF>>a short while ago.<<CRLF>>
Seemed like bad luck to have something like<<CRLF>>that around, you know?<<CRLF>>
Honestly, it's a real load off my mind to have<<CRLF>>it gone.<<CRLF>>

They may have only been warning shots, but<<CRLF>>nonetheless, what was shelling our town<<CRLF>>supposed to accomplish?
If their goal was to frighten, that's mission<<CRLF>>accomplished for sure...but it makes me angrier<<CRLF>>than it does scared!
If they'd hit any buildings, we would never be<<CRLF>>able to apologize to our ancestors profusely<<CRLF>>enough for letting their hard work get damaged.

#00400FExcuse me, Dario.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm? Do you have something you need<<CRLF>>me to--<<CRLF>>
Ah, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
P-perfect timing! I actually have something<<CRLF>>I need to discuss with you.<<CRLF>>
#00109F...So, what's on your mind?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
A-actually, it was about your gravestone, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I-I was the one who built it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Someone else asked me to do it, but still,<<CRLF>>I feel terrible. I hope its existence didn't<<CRLF>>cause you any bad luck.
I'm so, so sorry! Please, forgive me!<<CRLF>>I beg of you!<<CRLF>>
#00111F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's the thought that counts.
I'll never forgive you.
R-really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Phew... I'm glad you're not upset.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FAwww, you're so polite!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*whimper* Please, please forgive me! I really<<CRLF>>didn't mean any harm, I swear!<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol told Dario he was only joking.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00211F*sigh* Adol, Adol, Adol...<<CRLF>>What are we going to do with you?<<CRLF>>
#00305FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FIs something wrong, Ozma?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FA thought crossed my mind.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWas anything buried in that grave?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FOh, hey, now that you mention it...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FCan't be a body in there, so...is it just<<CRLF>>dirt?<<CRLF>>
No, our tradition for cases where there's no<<CRLF>>body are to bury the belongings of the decea--<<CRLF>>
I-I mean, Adol's belongings! That's what was<<CRLF>>buried in his grave.<<CRLF>>
I'm so, so sorry! It just slipped out, I didn't<<CRLF>>mean...<<CRLF>>
#00203FIt's okay, it's okay! We understand<<CRLF>>completely.<<CRLF>>
#00109FHmm... Adol's belongings...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FFrom before he lost his memories, no<<CRLF>>less.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThere may be new information to discover<<CRLF>>within them.<<CRLF>>
F-for real, I'm going to tell the mayor to have<<CRLF>>that grave removed really soon.<<CRLF>>
So please just wait a little bit longer! Please!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00412FAdol, I think we should probably be<<CRLF>>leaving now... For Dario's sake, if<<CRLF>>nothing else.
#00211FYeah, that sounds like a good idea. We<<CRLF>>don't want the poor guy to have a heart<<CRLF>>attack.
As soon as the mayor agrees, I'll have that<<CRLF>>grave removed right away.<<CRLF>>
I'm so, so sorry, but please just hang on a bit<<CRLF>>longer!<<CRLF>>
People whose names begin with 'Q', 'U' and<<CRLF>>'Z'... They're out there somewhere. Watching.<<CRLF>>Waiting. Calling to me, with voices like angels!
The world is full of so many interesting people<<CRLF>>with so many interesting names.<<CRLF>>
I'd really like to meet Quincy, Ursula and Zara<<CRLF>>in person someday. And maybe, just maybe, that<<CRLF>>day will come...
Lord Eldeel still isn't any better, is he?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I really hope he gets better soon.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder what the world outside Highland is<<CRLF>>like. I've read about it in books, but I'd<<CRLF>>love to see it for myself.
...Though I really don't want to get dragged<<CRLF>>into any disputes.<<CRLF>>
Everyone who comes to Highland is always<<CRLF>>particularly amazed by this building.<<CRLF>>
It must be a great feeling for your work to<<CRLF>>instill shock and awe in so many!<<CRLF>>
I'm really proud to have had such amazing<<CRLF>>ancestors.<<CRLF>>
It must be a great feeling for your work to<<CRLF>>instill shock and awe in so many!<<CRLF>>
I'm really proud to have had such amazing<<CRLF>>ancestors.<<CRLF>>
If we had lots of Apostles, I'm sure they<<CRLF>>could've just used their magic to outclass<<CRLF>>those soldiers and subdue them on the spot.
Victory goes to the one with the largest<<CRLF>>numbers, after all!<<CRLF>>
When I grow up, I want to be an architect.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My father, my grandfather and my great<<CRLF>>grandfather were all architects, and I'd<<CRLF>>love to follow in their footsteps.
#4CVarious quests are displayed on the board.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FIs this...some kind of shop?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWell, technically, yes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FThis is Philemon's Workshop, and the<<CRLF>>staff here are responsible for all of the<<CRLF>>machinery in Highland.
#00209FMa...chine...ry?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FOh, you aren't familiar with machines?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, Karna and Ozma're from the forest<<CRLF>>and live off the land, so they've never seen<<CRLF>>machines like the ones here before.
#00300FYou have seen them, then, I assume?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FYeah. Machines are, uh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FComplicated contraption thingies that do<<CRLF>>stuff. In a nutshell.<<CRLF>>
#00209FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00211F...that your explanation was no help at<<CRLF>>all.<<CRLF>>
#00405FAnd there you have it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00412FIt's a shame your brain isn't as big as<<CRLF>>your body, or you'd be quite the genius!<<CRLF>>
#00101FOh, come on, now! Give me a break!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, you. Big guy over there. You're blocking<<CRLF>>the entrance.<<CRLF>>
If you want to talk, move over and stop<<CRLF>>getting in the way of other customers.<<CRLF>>
#00111F...Why am I the only one who gets told<<CRLF>>off?<<CRLF>>
It's nice to see you all.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And it's particularly good to see you alive,<<CRLF>>Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00300FWe were discussing how this workshop<<CRLF>>is responsible for all of the machinery in<<CRLF>>Highland.
#00300FDoes that mean those windmills outside<<CRLF>>were created here as well?<<CRLF>>
That's right. I was responsible for designing<<CRLF>>them, in fact.<<CRLF>>
Thanks to the knowledge I received from Lord<<CRLF>>Eldeel, anyway.<<CRLF>>
...Though all of the wisdom I was given has<<CRLF>>also been given to someone else as well.<<CRLF>>
#00309FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205FI still don't really get it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FBut I can tell you're an amazing person,<<CRLF>>at least.<<CRLF>>
Haha, but of course! You're a perceptive one,<<CRLF>>young lady.<<CRLF>>
...Don't get cocky, old man.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FAre all the girls in Highland like this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FI thought it was just Calilica, but this one<<CRLF>>seems like a handful too.<<CRLF>>
#00411FHaha. Well, Timali is Philemon's successor,<<CRLF>>so she's not exactly your run-of-the-mill girl.<<CRLF>>
Indeed. You may now bow before me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FIs that...Gazock?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FGazock? Wasn't that the traveling<<CRLF>>merchant we met in Selray? ...Holy crap,<<CRLF>>it is him!
#00309FWhat are you doing here, Gazock?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Actually, I happened to see you entering the<<CRLF>>ruins, and decided to follow you.<<CRLF>>
I did get lost along the way, but I managed to<<CRLF>>make it here in the end. Just now, in fact.<<CRLF>>
#00111F...Seriously?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI can't believe you made it all this way<<CRLF>>on your own. Those ruins are pretty<<CRLF>>dangerous, you know!
Wahaha! They don't call me Gazock the Strong for<<CRLF>>nothing. I know that forest like the back of my<<CRLF>>hand!
And I'm not letting some little monsters get the<<CRLF>>best of me!<<CRLF>>
#00203FAmazing. You must be stronger than you<<CRLF>>look.<<CRLF>>
Wahaha! I hear that a lot.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Anyway...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There's something you should know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...I'm actually from Highland.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00110FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00308FWh-what are you talking about?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm. Perhaps I should be the one to explain.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You see, Gazock here is my younger brother.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FR-really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If I told you the whole story, we'd be here all<<CRLF>>night. So, to summarize...<<CRLF>>
A few decades ago, I got myself into a bit<<CRLF>>of trouble. Took a little spill, you could say.<<CRLF>>
And eventually found myself washed up on the<<CRLF>>opposite side of the river.<<CRLF>>
I was saved by the people of Selray, and...well,<<CRLF>>that was that.<<CRLF>>
#00300FYou have been a beloved resident of<<CRLF>>Selray ever since I was born, so I had<<CRLF>>no idea...
#00305FI would have never had any way to know<<CRLF>>that you came from the other side of the<<CRLF>>river.
#00109F...Wait, so is this supposed to be, like, a<<CRLF>>big teary-eyed reunion of long-lost brothers<<CRLF>>or something?
It was, yes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Until you all barged in and ruined everything.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, it's no bother at all...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What was it you came here for? Did you need<<CRLF>>something?<<CRLF>>
We came to buy supplies.
We came to reinforce our equipment.
I don't have anything I can sell to you,<<CRLF>>unfortunately...<<CRLF>>
Oh, if I use the facilities here, I should be<<CRLF>>able to reinforce your weapons and armor.<<CRLF>>
#00209FReally?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FThat sounds like it'd be a hell of an<<CRLF>>imposition, though... Adol, you shouldn't<<CRLF>>ask things like that!
Honestly... I'm all right with it if you are,<<CRLF>>Gazock.<<CRLF>>
No problem! With these facilities, I'll be able<<CRLF>>to take care of that for you, no problem.<<CRLF>>
#00109FAre you sure?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Of course! If you have the materials, I can even<<CRLF>>craft some accessories for you.<<CRLF>>
I am Gazock the Strong, after all!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Though back when I lived here before, people<<CRLF>>called me 'Gazock the Super Handyman'<<CRLF>>instead.
Haha. We'll go along with that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Feel free to work Gazock hard while he's here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThis house...seems to be empty.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FThis is Leeza's house.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FBut Leeza is out most of the time, so it's<<CRLF>>usually empty.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWhat about her family?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404F...She lives on her own.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FBoth of her parents passed away the<<CRLF>>year I was born.<<CRLF>>
#00209FOh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FAnd that's pretty much all there is to see<<CRLF>>of Leeza's house.<<CRLF>>
#00400FLet's move on, shall we?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CA highly detailed model sits atop the desk. It seems to depict a<<CRLF>>battlefield.<<CRLF>>
<< mp4202m.JSON_TEXT 36 >>
#00411F...I see, so that's what happened when<<CRLF>>you were in Promalock...<<CRLF>>
#00400FWell, then, I guess the next thing I'd like to ask<<CRLF>>is--<<CRLF>>
Hold on a minute, Calilica. You've asked enough<<CRLF>>questions!<<CRLF>>
At least let the rest of us have a chance to<<CRLF>>sneak one or two in.<<CRLF>>
Yeah! He's not all yours!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FHmm... I suppose you're right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Okay, my turn!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My question is about all the pikkards you've run<<CRLF>>into on your travels.<<CRLF>>
Yes, I think you can save stupid questions like<<CRLF>>that until the end of time.<<CRLF>>
The end of...time...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
More importantly, Adol... Do you have a<<CRLF>>girlfriend?<<CRLF>>
Being pretty cute AND a strong warrior, I'm sure<<CRLF>>you must have all the ladies swooning all over<<CRLF>>you...
You haven't got a childhood friend back home<<CRLF>>you've sworn to spend your life with or<<CRLF>>something, have you?
Or do you have passionate encounters with<<CRLF>>different girls everywhere you go?<<CRLF>>
...I don't know whether to take that reaction<<CRLF>>to mean you're pure-hearted or...if I hit the<<CRLF>>nail right on the head...
Come to think of it, you seemed to be getting<<CRLF>>on really well with Leeza.<<CRLF>>
You're not after her, are you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you are, don't think you'll be getting off<<CRLF>>with just a slap on the wrist!<<CRLF>>
#00405FI-I'm sure Adol would never approach such<<CRLF>>a serious matter halfheartedly!<<CRLF>>
#00401F...But if you were ever to make Leeza cry,<<CRLF>>I'd be forced to cut all that lovely red hair<<CRLF>>off in your sleep. You've been warned.
Adol, I think I speak for all men when I say<<CRLF>>I completely sympathize with your plight.<<CRLF>>
Y-yeah...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Anyway, going back to the pikkards...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411F...Okay, everyone, how about this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FIf you all keep showering poor Adol with<<CRLF>>questions, it's probably going to make him<<CRLF>>very uncomfortable.
#00400FSo from now on, everyone will be able to<<CRLF>>ask him one question, and one question<<CRLF>>only!
#16SWhaaat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I suppose that does make sense, though. At this<<CRLF>>rate, we'd be here for hours otherwise.<<CRLF>>
Okay, finally! So, starting with me...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00405FHold on. I'll be deciding the order.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403F...And that order is, me first.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But you've been asking him questions this<<CRLF>>whole time! You've had more than enough!<<CRLF>>
Yeah! This isn't fair at all!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heheheh. That's our Calilica.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No one's going to be able to take control from<<CRLF>>her now...<<CRLF>>
<< mp4203.JSON_TEXT 640 >>
#0MAllow me to introduce myself. My name is Aaron.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI am the mayor of this town, and Calilica's<<CRLF>>grandfather.<<CRLF>>
#0MI must say, it's amazing to see you alive again,<<CRLF>>Adol. I had assumed...I never would.<<CRLF>>
I saw the grave.
I have a lot of questions.
#14205FBefore you returned, we were under the<<CRLF>>impression that you had died.<<CRLF>>
#14200FIt must have been quite a shock to see it,<<CRLF>>but think how we must feel to see you<<CRLF>>standing before us now!
#14205FI fear I may not be able to answer in as<<CRLF>>much detail as you'd like. But I will say<<CRLF>>what I can.
#00300FMay I ask why you believed Adol to be<<CRLF>>dead?<<CRLF>>
#14200FWe found Adol's belongings near a<<CRLF>>waterfall in this area, but Adol<<CRLF>>himself was nowhere to be seen.
#14205FWe searched for days, but could find no<<CRLF>>trace of him.<<CRLF>>
#14205FWe had little choice but to believe he had<<CRLF>>accidentally fallen in and drowned.<<CRLF>>
#00109FHeh. Something tells me drowning's not<<CRLF>>too likely to be the way this one goes out!<<CRLF>>
#14200FI can't even imagine how confusing this<<CRLF>>must all be for you.<<CRLF>>
#14200FBut, in order to explain things adequately,<<CRLF>>I would be forced to detail a number of...<<CRLF>>private matters regarding these lands.
#14200FAnd I honestly cannot say how much I'm<<CRLF>>at liberty to discuss right now.<<CRLF>>
#14205F...Calilica?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FYes, Grandfather?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FWhen Leeza returns from the Rite of<<CRLF>>Summoning, would you please ask her<<CRLF>>to come by?
#00409FIs...she returning today?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FIndeed. Although, it may be past nightfall<<CRLF>>by then.<<CRLF>>
#14200FEither way, I will need to consult with<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel on this matter.<<CRLF>>
#00403FYaaay!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FUntil I have done so, I'm afraid I'll have<<CRLF>>to ask you to remain here, in our guest<<CRLF>>quarters.
For how long?
Can we look around outside?
#14200FI cannot say for certain. I will call for you<<CRLF>>when the necessary preparations have<<CRLF>>been made.
#14200FI don't think that would be wise,<<CRLF>>particularly after what happened<<CRLF>>last time you were here.
#14200FAnd your arrival has caused quite a<<CRLF>>commotion in town already.<<CRLF>>
#14200FI apologize for the inconvenience, but I<<CRLF>>think it would be best if you stayed<<CRLF>>indoors for the night.
#14200FWe'll do what we can to make your stay<<CRLF>>a pleasant one. Calilica, would you please<<CRLF>>show our guests to their quarters?
#00400FOf course!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FWell, since arriving here, we've learned...<<CRLF>>not much.<<CRLF>>
#00305FI am inclined to disagree.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FIf this is where Adol's tracks end, there is<<CRLF>>a high probability that this is where he<<CRLF>>lost his memories.
#00300FIt may not seem like much to go on, but<<CRLF>>it is a solid lead nonetheless.<<CRLF>>
#00200FDid anyone else find Calilica and the<<CRLF>>mayor's reactions to Adol's memory<<CRLF>>loss kind of...weird?
#00200FI mean, they didn't seem surprised at all.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThere's definitely something strange about<<CRLF>>this town.<<CRLF>>
#00101FThe technology here's pretty advanced,<<CRLF>>too. They've even got windmills and<<CRLF>>street lights.
#00209FWhat's a street light?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FOh, right. They're little devices...on sticks,<<CRLF>>basically...that light up when it's nighttime.<<CRLF>>
#00100FIn big towns, you can have a bunch of 'em<<CRLF>>along the side of a road. Then when night<<CRLF>>falls, turn 'em on and it's bright as day!
#00203FWow! That's incredible!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FBut you sure don't hear of too many<<CRLF>>towns that use them. Heck, you'd be<<CRLF>>hard pressed to find one even in Romn.
#00104FHonestly, this town might just be more<<CRLF>>advanced than any place I've seen or heard<<CRLF>>about in the whole Empire!
#00101FMakes you wonder, what's a town like<<CRLF>>this doing in the middle of the Great<<CRLF>>Forest?
#00111F...You manage to remember anything yet,<<CRLF>>Adol?<<CRLF>>
Not yet.
I think I remember...Eldeel?
#00111FYeah, didn't think so.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOh, that's the guy the mayor mentioned.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FWhoever he is, he sounds pretty important,<<CRLF>>the way those two were talking about him.<<CRLF>>
#00305FAll we know about him is his name,<<CRLF>>however. Beyond that, we can only<<CRLF>>speculate.
#00305FI think it would be best for us to rest<<CRLF>>now, and trust that our questions will<<CRLF>>be answered come morning.
#00203FSounds like a good idea to me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206FMmm...nnnngggyyyyggghh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206FIs it...time for dinner...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FFrieda...give me a break...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAfter much tossing and turning, Adol finally gave up on trying to<<CRLF>>get to sleep. There was simply too much going through his head.<<CRLF>>
#4CThe window isn't locked. It might be possible to slip out from<<CRLF>>here.<<CRLF>>
#4CWill you go outside?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yes
No
#4CA winged statue stands beyond the entrance.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CIt looks similar to the statues in Casnia Mine and the Underground<<CRLF>>Ruins.<<CRLF>>
#0621VAre you unable to sleep?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000F#0622VI'm so happy you're alive, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000F#0624VDo you remember my name?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Lilia
Leeza
#14004FI see your memories have still not fully<<CRLF>>returned.<<CRLF>>
#14000FMy name is Leeza.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FOh...so you do remember me, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14006FThat makes me very happy.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FWould you like to talk for a while, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FAh, I see... You remembered my name,<<CRLF>>but pretended not to.<<CRLF>>
#14004FYour kindly aura belies a mischievous<<CRLF>>spirit, it seems!<<CRLF>>
#14000FU-um...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FIf you don't mind me asking, how much<<CRLF>>do you remember about Lord Eldeel?<<CRLF>>
#14000F...I see. So your memories of me only<<CRLF>>just returned a moment ago?<<CRLF>>
#14003FHeh. What a wonderful coincidence.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FU-um... If you don't mind me asking, how<<CRLF>>much do you remember about Lord Eldeel?<<CRLF>>
Not much.
Only our first meeting.
#14000FI...see... Still, I am pleased that you<<CRLF>>remember anything about him at all.<<CRLF>>
#14000FReally, now? That's most impressive.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FIf your memory has recovered that much,<<CRLF>>then perhaps you've already realized this,<<CRLF>>but...
#14000FLord Eldeel personally chose you, and<<CRLF>>summoned you to this land.<<CRLF>>
#14000FHe intended to impart upon you the<<CRLF>>knowledge of the tower.<<CRLF>>
#14004F...Unfortunately, you vanished before you<<CRLF>>could receive it.<<CRLF>>
#14004FAnd I'm afraid I don't know what specific<<CRLF>>knowledge Lord Eldeel intended to impart.<<CRLF>>
#14000FI feel I should also disclose to you...<<CRLF>>the truth regarding your memories. Or at<<CRLF>>least, some of them.
#14000FThe area surrounding the Sanctuary is<<CRLF>>protected by a special kind of barrier.<<CRLF>>
#14000FWhen outsiders leave, they forget every-<<CRLF>>thing that happened here. It's as if they<<CRLF>>never came.
Why?
Is that how I lost my memories?
#14000FTo avoid the existence of this town and<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel becoming discovered by the<<CRLF>>outside world.
#14000FI believe that you lost your memories<<CRLF>>when you left this area.<<CRLF>>
#14000FMost likely, yes. I believe the barrier did...<<CRLF>>what it was supposed to do when you left<<CRLF>>the area.
#14000FI do apologize. The barrier is in place to<<CRLF>>prevent this town and Lord Eldeel from<<CRLF>>becoming discovered by the world.
#14004FHowever, you should only have lost your<<CRLF>>memories of Highland and its environs.<<CRLF>>Nothing more.
But...I lost ALL my memories...
Has anything like this happened before?
#14004FI-I'm sorry. I really have no idea what<<CRLF>>could have caused that to occur.<<CRLF>>
#14004FN-no. I'm sorry. There have never been<<CRLF>>any reports of full amnesia occurring in<<CRLF>>those who leave here.
#14000FI've also never heard of anyone regaining<<CRLF>>their memories of Highland upon returning,<<CRLF>>either.
#14000FIt may be some time before he can grant<<CRLF>>an audience with you, but I'm certain you'll<<CRLF>>be able to speak with Lord Eldeel again.
#14000F...However, it's late, and you need your<<CRLF>>rest. I'll see you again tomorrow.<<CRLF>>
#14000FI'm just...so relieved to learn that you're<<CRLF>>alive!<<CRLF>>
#14004FOh, and Adol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FIf you should remember anything else<<CRLF>>about Lord Eldeel...<<CRLF>>
#14000F...I-I'm sorry, it's nothing.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14003FGood night to you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00211F...Sorry, Adol, can you explain that again?<<CRLF>>From the beginning?<<CRLF>>
#00305FI doubt repeating the explanation will<<CRLF>>make its contents any easier to understand.<<CRLF>>
#00305FAnd I must confess, it is most difficult to<<CRLF>>believe such a tale could possibly be true...<<CRLF>>
#00105FSo basically, this Eldeel guy is like some<<CRLF>>kind of god that gives people knowledge?<<CRLF>>
#00111FWe've seen some strange things on our<<CRLF>>journey so far, but this is pushing it...<<CRLF>>
#00305FThere is one point I would like to be<<CRLF>>clarified.<<CRLF>>
#00305FYou said that upon leaving this area, you<<CRLF>>forget everything that happened here,<<CRLF>>correct?
#00300FSurely that would mean forgetting the<<CRLF>>knowledge you were given as well, no?<<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah, that's a good point...so go on,<<CRLF>>Calilica or whatever your name is. What's<<CRLF>>up with that?
#00401FHmph.<<CRLF>>That's no way to ask someone a question!<<CRLF>>
#00105FHah, well, I'm older than you, so there!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00412FYou certainly wouldn't be able to tell from<<CRLF>>how you talk. You're like a spoiled child.<<CRLF>>
#00411FThe idea that you should respect your<<CRLF>>elders because of their age is so outdated.<<CRLF>>Respect is earned through maturity.
#00411FAnd people like you don't become<<CRLF>>mature as they get older, they just turn<<CRLF>>into grumpy old farts.
#00112FWh-what?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00413FNyeeeeh!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FHeheh. I think Calilica wins this one.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FBut it's true that the people who receive<<CRLF>>knowledge forget coming here.<<CRLF>>
#00400FHowever, the knowledge imparted by<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel remains within the mind, <<CRLF>>resurfacing one day as 'inspiration.'
#00209FInspiration? What do you mean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FI believe she is stating that the knowledge<<CRLF>>a person is given resurfaces during his<<CRLF>>daily life as if it were his own thought.
#00305FIs that correct?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FOoooh! *clapclapclap*<<CRLF>>It's good to see the rest of you actually<<CRLF>>have measurable intelligence...
#00412F...unlike a certain someone here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FHmph.<<CRLF>>...Pretty fancy system you've got going<<CRLF>>here, though.
#00105FSo if people remember the knowledge<<CRLF>>they've been given as if they thought of<<CRLF>>it themselves...
#00109F...does that mean everyone who's ever<<CRLF>>invented something great has been here<<CRLF>>before?
#14205FNaturally not everyone, but that is true for<<CRLF>>certain people and certain inventions, yes.<<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* Unbelievable...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FSo...can we actually go outside now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FYou may. Leeza has explained everything<<CRLF>>to the people of this town, so there should<<CRLF>>be no further problems.
#00100FOkay, Adol, I dunno about you, but those<<CRLF>>are the words I've been dyin' to hear. Time<<CRLF>>to go snoop around town!
Indubitably!
I can't wait!
#00100FHopefully we can find some way to get a<<CRLF>>few more of your memories back.<<CRLF>>
#00100FListening to people talk might help this<<CRLF>>whole thing sink in a bit, too.<<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, don't get too carried away! Gotta be<<CRLF>>careful not to overlook anything that might<<CRLF>>help you get your memories back.
#00100FThat's our top priority, remember!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FHmm? Something wrong?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FOh, nothing. You just...sometimes don't<<CRLF>>seem like you're all there, then it's like<<CRLF>>you'll say the perfect thing. Weird!
#00105FR-really? I mean, I am a reputed infor-<<CRLF>>mation dealer and all that. I absorb<<CRLF>>everything around me, and... Hey!
#14200FCalilica, I would like to entrust you as<<CRLF>>their guide. Please show them every-<<CRLF>>thing this town has to offer.
#00400FOkay!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14205FHowever, Adol, I must warn you of one<<CRLF>>thing.<<CRLF>>
#14200FDo not, under any circumstances, leave the<<CRLF>>town through the north exit by yourselves.<<CRLF>>
#00309FThe north exit? In the direction of that<<CRLF>>enormous tower?<<CRLF>>
#00411FThat tower is where Lord Eldeel lives. It's<<CRLF>>also where Adol met Lord Eldeel when he<<CRLF>>last came here.
#00400FHowever, it's surrounded by an area called<<CRLF>>the Sanctuary of Storms.<<CRLF>>
#00400FAnd if you enter there without permission,<<CRLF>>you'll be fried by lightning before you know<<CRLF>>it! So don't say we didn't warn you.
#00109F...O-okay. That seems like a pretty good<<CRLF>>incentive to keep our distance to me!<<CRLF>>
#00203FThat's our cue, Adol! Let's check this<<CRLF>>place out!<<CRLF>>
#00105FAll right then, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe gathered a fair amount of information,<<CRLF>>at least. There anything in particular that<<CRLF>>stands out to you?
About Eldeel...
About the Apostles...
#00109FThe winged god you're supposed to have<<CRLF>>met before you lost your memories?<<CRLF>>
#00100FHe sure seems to be loved by everyone<<CRLF>>around here.<<CRLF>>
#00200FWell, if he's really been living in that<<CRLF>>tower for hundreds of years, then he's<<CRLF>>not an ordinary human, that's for sure.
#00200FAnd he's supposed to be in perfect<<CRLF>>health, not like some old man or anything.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThose statues in the forest supposedly<<CRLF>>were cast in his image.<<CRLF>>
#00300FWhich means there is a high likelihood<<CRLF>>that he has some connection with the<<CRLF>>ancient Kingdom of Celceta.
#00300FWhile we cannot be certain until we have<<CRLF>>met him for ourselves, he does seem to<<CRLF>>fit the very definition of a god...
#00105FYeah, this whole Eldeel thing is definitely<<CRLF>>an interesting development.<<CRLF>>
#00100FBut I was thinking of something else. <<CRLF>>Something that might help figure out<<CRLF>>what happened to you here, Adol.
#00105FThe Apostles? Those people who serve<<CRLF>>Eldeel?<<CRLF>>
#00100F...I guess now that you mention it,<<CRLF>>Leeza's one of them, too...<<CRLF>>
#00305FWe were told that each Apostle has a<<CRLF>>different role to perform.<<CRLF>>
#00201FAnd Leeza's role is to bring Eldeel's chosen<<CRLF>>beneficiaries to the tower so they can meet<<CRLF>>with him, right?
#00201FSo how does she make it through the<<CRLF>>forest?<<CRLF>>
#00101FYou said there were no signs that Adol<<CRLF>>had passed through those Underground<<CRLF>>Ruins...
#00101FMaybe the way she does it can explain<<CRLF>>that, too. Doesn't sound like she uses<<CRLF>>any run-of-the-mill methods, at any rate.
#00305FI do feel there may be more to learn<<CRLF>>here...<<CRLF>>
#00300FBut I believe we learned some information<<CRLF>>that may prove more immediately useful<<CRLF>>to us.
About that shady man and woman...
About my belongings...
#00204F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FThere's still a lot left to find out about<<CRLF>>those two, for sure.<<CRLF>>
#00100FBut right now, we gotta trace your where-<<CRLF>>abouts from when you were here before,<<CRLF>>and find out what happened to you.
#00100FSo personally, I'm a lot more interested in<<CRLF>>your belongings. Like, your old belongings,<<CRLF>>before you lost your memory.
#00100FYeah, I was thinking that too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FIf you really fell into that waterfall, your<<CRLF>>belongings could hold the key to this<<CRLF>>whole mystery.
#00200FThis could be our chance to see what<<CRLF>>Adol had with him before he disappeared!<<CRLF>>
#00204FAssuming we can even get to them,<<CRLF>>since they've been...<<CRLF>>
Lost
Buried
#00111FHuh, really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI know you lost them, but it sounds to me<<CRLF>>like the townsfolk here found them not too<<CRLF>>long afterward.
#00103FAnd since everyone thought you were<<CRLF>>dead...<<CRLF>>
#00209F...They buried them in your grave!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Time for some grave robbing!
We should consult with Aaron.
#00103FThat settles it, then!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FPermission from the dead guy himself<<CRLF>>means no curse, no problem...just a little<<CRLF>>playin' in the dirt, and bam! Answers.
#00305FThere is not a moment to waste.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FYou want to ask the mayor...for per-<<CRLF>>mission to dig up your grave? Or to<<CRLF>>dig it up on our behalf?
#00105FEither way, what'll we do if he says no?<<CRLF>>Then it'll be kind of awkward when we go<<CRLF>>digging it up anyway.
#00100FI think it's best we just do it in secret.<<CRLF>>It's your grave, after all!<<CRLF>>
#00300FI concur. It is much simpler this way.<<CRLF>>Come, there is not a moment to waste.<<CRLF>>
#14009FYou would like to speak with Lord Eldeel?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah. I don't think we're gonna get to the<<CRLF>>bottom of what happened to Adol without<<CRLF>>talking to him at least once.
#14200FI agree, a consultation with Lord Eldeel<<CRLF>>seems wise.<<CRLF>>
#14205FIt is, after all, my responsibility that one<<CRLF>>of his valued guests went missing.<<CRLF>>
#14200FI would like to discuss matters with him<<CRLF>>as soon as possible myself.<<CRLF>>
#14200F...Is something the matter, Leeza?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FU-um...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200F...Leeza?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FActually...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FActually, there's something I need to tell<<CRLF>>you about Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#14201FOh? You sound hesitant. Please, don't be<<CRLF>>shy. What is it you need to tell me?<<CRLF>>
#14001FLord Eldeel...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001F...Lord Eldeel is rather unwell at the<<CRLF>>moment.<<CRLF>>
#14004FHe claims he has a kind of...chronic<<CRLF>>disease.<<CRLF>>
#14201FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14201FLord Eldeel is ill? I was unaware this<<CRLF>>was even possible... To my knowledge,<<CRLF>>he has never taken ill, even once!
#14004FI'm sure he would be very happy to<<CRLF>>know Adol is alive and well, but...<<CRLF>>
#14004FIf you could at least wait until his<<CRLF>>condition improves...<<CRLF>>
#00111FI see.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, guess we don't really have much<<CRLF>>of a choice in the matter. If he's sick, he's<<CRLF>>sick!
#00209F...Duren?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FI'm terribly sorry.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FI'll be certain to inform Lord Eldeel of your<<CRLF>>arrival at the first available opportunity.<<CRLF>>
#00401F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FMan, I can't believe this! Do we really<<CRLF>>have to wait until GOD feels better<<CRLF>>before we can talk to him?!
#00201FAnd our hands are tied until then, too,<<CRLF>>since we told them we wouldn't wander<<CRLF>>too far outside the town...
#00305FFirst Adol's memories, and now Eldeel's<<CRLF>>unprecedented illness... It seems a lot of<<CRLF>>unusual things are happening here lately.
#00203FIt's like everywhere Adol goes, trouble<<CRLF>>follows.<<CRLF>>
Especially lately!
Hey! It's not my fault...
#00203FI dunno if I believe that. I'm willing to bet<<CRLF>>you've always been this way. You probably<<CRLF>>just don't remember!
#00203F...Sorry. I guess that might have sounded<<CRLF>>a little mean.<<CRLF>>
#00200FStill, we four would've never met one<<CRLF>>another if it weren't for you, so it's not<<CRLF>>like you're always causing problems!
#00200FI have no idea what kinds of unimaginable<<CRLF>>horrors await us in the future...<<CRLF>>
#00203FBut I know I don't regret coming with<<CRLF>>you.<<CRLF>>
#00306F...Nor do I.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What's on your mind, Duren?
You're acting kind of strange, Duren.
#00109FHuh? Oh, you talking to me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThis is only a suggestion, Adol, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FO-oh, sorry, I was just...thinking.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThis is only a suggestion, Adol, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FHow about we sneak out of town tonight<<CRLF>>and go to Eldeel's tower ourselves?<<CRLF>>
#00209FWhat? Weren't we just told not to do<<CRLF>>exactly that?!<<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, I...have a hunch. I mean, I can't<<CRLF>>prove it or anything, but still...<<CRLF>>
#00101FThat Leeza girl seems to be hiding<<CRLF>>something. I got a feeling it's real<<CRLF>>important.
#00101FAnd what's stranger is, I don't get the<<CRLF>>impression it's us she's hiding it from.<<CRLF>>
#00101FIf anything, she seems to be hiding it<<CRLF>>from the people of Highland.<<CRLF>>
#00300FAre you referring to her account of<<CRLF>>Eldeel's illness?<<CRLF>>
#00305FShe did seem overly hesitant to mention<<CRLF>>it, with no obvious explanation for her<<CRLF>>reluctance.
#00100FDon't get me wrong, she seems like a<<CRLF>>nice girl, but...I get the feeling there's<<CRLF>>more to this than meets the eye.
#00305FI think it has been made quite clear to<<CRLF>>us that this town is unique in a great<<CRLF>>many ways.
#00305FAnd with individuals acting to make the<<CRLF>>situation even more complicated...<<CRLF>>
#00300F...there is a high probability that no matter<<CRLF>>how long we wait, there will be no reso-<<CRLF>>lution to this dilemma.
#00103FThat's just what I was gonna say!<<CRLF>>Except...in smaller words...<<CRLF>>
#00209FI'm kinda surprised, though. I figured<<CRLF>>you'd be against it for sure.<<CRLF>>
#00300FWe all have our reasons for being here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI am tired of simply waiting for things to<<CRLF>>happen. The time has come for us to be<<CRLF>>arbiters of our own destinies.
#00200FThat's the spirit!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWhat about you, Adol? How do you feel<<CRLF>>about this?<<CRLF>>
Let's do it!
I'm not completely against the idea.
#00111FDon't know why I even bothered asking.<<CRLF>>Your eyes lit up like fireworks as soon as<<CRLF>>I mentioned sneaking off. So hopeless.
#00111FOh, don't try to act all coy now, Adol. I<<CRLF>>can read you like a book. Your excite-<<CRLF>>ment's plastered all over your face!
#00100F...So, I guess that's that, then. We should<<CRLF>>start getting ready, as something tells me<<CRLF>>this won't be an easy journey!
#00100FIt'd be best if we got to the tower before<<CRLF>>dawn.<<CRLF>>
#4CThe window is unlocked. Will you go outside?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Yes
No
#00109FSo this is how you've been getting out?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FThis is so exciting!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FShhh! We need to leave before anyone<<CRLF>>notices us.<<CRLF>>
#14200FThe residents are still in a state of<<CRLF>>confusion.<<CRLF>>
#00305FConsidering this town has known<<CRLF>>nothing but peace for hundreds of years,<<CRLF>>it is hardly surprising.
#00305FFar too much has happened in too short<<CRLF>>a space of time.<<CRLF>>
#00300FWe need to consider what to do next,<<CRLF>>Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00101FThe Romuns sure didn't hang around long.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FI think they really are heading farther<<CRLF>>into the forest.<<CRLF>>
#00300F...What do you think Gruda is searching<<CRLF>>for?<<CRLF>>
The Mask of the Sun
Eldeel
#00300FI agree. That does seem the most likely<<CRLF>>possibility.<<CRLF>>
#00300FHe seems to be part of their plan, but as<<CRLF>>they are heading deeper into the forest, it<<CRLF>>appears he is not their ultimate objective.
#00300FI believe their real target to be the Mask<<CRLF>>of the Sun.<<CRLF>>
#00104FYeah. When Eldeel started changing, he<<CRLF>>was demanding that Adol give it back to<<CRLF>>him.
#00305FDo you remember the piece of paper that<<CRLF>>we found in your grave, Adol?<<CRLF>>
It said, 'Tower'...
It said, 'Received the Mask from'...
#00105FNah, that was a memo in your notebook.<<CRLF>>The one Ozma's talking about is the scrap<<CRLF>>that said, 'Received the Mask from'...
#00300FCorrect.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FBefore losing his memories, Adol must<<CRLF>>have received the Mask of the Sun from<<CRLF>>Eldeel.
#00300FThen, when Eldeel changed personalities<<CRLF>>during our conversation with him, he told<<CRLF>>Adol to return that which had been given.
#00300FThat is the most plausible course of<<CRLF>>events.<<CRLF>>
#00101FMeanwhile, Gruda was using Gadis and<<CRLF>>Bami to study the Mask of the Sun, and<<CRLF>>even make copies of it.
#00101FAnd now they've come to the Primeval<<CRLF>>Lands to get the real one.<<CRLF>>
#14205FI-I see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FHowever, we still do not know exactly<<CRLF>>what the 'Mask of the Sun' even is.<<CRLF>>
#00300FDo you have any information you could<<CRLF>>share with us, Mayor?<<CRLF>>
#14200FThe Kingdom of Celceta...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FKingdom...of Celceta?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14205F...In ancient times a kingdom by that<<CRLF>>name existed in this region.<<CRLF>>
#14200FSupposedly, Lord Eldeel assisted in its<<CRLF>>rulings many hundreds of years ago.<<CRLF>>
#14200FIt is also said that the kingdom flourished<<CRLF>>thanks to the power granted by the Mask<<CRLF>>of the Sun.
#14200FHowever, something happened that caused<<CRLF>>the once prosperous kingdom to be des-<<CRLF>>troyed. Precious few traces remain now.
What happened?
When was this?
#14200FI'm afraid I cannot say. Supposedly, the<<CRLF>>people of Highland are descendants of the<<CRLF>>Kingdom of Celceta.
#14200FBut no records exist which describe exactly<<CRLF>>how the Kingdom fell.<<CRLF>>
#14200FI hear it was roughly eight hundred years<<CRLF>>ago.<<CRLF>>
#14200FHowever, I am afraid I do not know what<<CRLF>>caused its downfall.<<CRLF>>
#14200FLord Eldeel has never spoken of it, either.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIt seems our best option would be to<<CRLF>>meet him again and ask him to tell us<<CRLF>>all he knows. However...
#00400FWe're back!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FExcellent timing. How did it go?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FW-well...uhhh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14202F#16SLord Eldeel has vanished?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FWe searched the area all around the tower,<<CRLF>>but there was no trace of him anywhere.<<CRLF>>
#14205FOrdinarily, he would only leave his room<<CRLF>>to visit the town, and even that occurs<<CRLF>>with marked rarity.
#00404FAnd unfortunately, the bad news doesn't<<CRLF>>stop there.<<CRLF>>
#00404FI'm afraid we can't find Leeza anywhere,<<CRLF>>either.<<CRLF>>
#00309FCould Gruda have abducted her?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FLeeza may seem...dainty, but she's<<CRLF>>actually pretty quick-witted.<<CRLF>>
#00404FI don't think she would allow herself to<<CRLF>>be captured so easily.<<CRLF>>
#00204FStill, I'm worried about both her and<<CRLF>>Eldeel. We need to do something!<<CRLF>>
#00111FWho is it now? We're busy, you know!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FCould it be Leeza?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MIs this the mayor's house?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI am the great Commander Leo of the Romun<<CRLF>>Imperial Celcetan Army!<<CRLF>>
#0MDamn that Gruda! How could he leave a fine<<CRLF>>warrior like me behind?!<<CRLF>>
#10505FWell, they've been treating us like we're<<CRLF>>nothing but trouble since the beginning...<<CRLF>>
#10604FI wanted one of those masks too...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FSilence! The soldiers of the glorious<<CRLF>>Celcetan Army have no need for such<<CRLF>>suspicious masks!
#00111FSeems like the Romuns are a little out of<<CRLF>>sorts right now too.<<CRLF>>
#10009FHas Gruda been here yet?! I can't find<<CRLF>>him anywhere...<<CRLF>>
You're too late.
He went ahead already.
#10005FWhat?! That fiend! Setting a cunning trap<<CRLF>>just so he could get ahead of us!<<CRLF>>
#10600F...Sancho, didn't he get ahead of us<<CRLF>>because the Commander got a stomach<<CRLF>>ache?
#10501FYep. And it serves him right for hoarding<<CRLF>>all those mushrooms before we even left!<<CRLF>>
#10002FN-never mind that! We've more important<<CRLF>>issues to discuss than mushrooms! Why<<CRLF>>is he not following orders?!
#10002FWhat?! He went on ahead?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FThat was not in the orders we received<<CRLF>>from the office of the Governor General!<<CRLF>>
#10005FOur orders were to claim the mayor's<<CRLF>>home and use it as a base, from which we<<CRLF>>would enact martial law upon the town.
Woman's Voice
Those orders are void.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10008FG-Governor General? Wh-what brings you<<CRLF>>to a place like...<<CRLF>>
#10002F#16S...*ahem* Men! Fall in!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FAdol! Don't just stand there! You're in the<<CRLF>>presence of the Governor General!<<CRLF>>
#10105FAt ease, Leo.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...Unbelievable. The Governor General<<CRLF>>herself, coming all the way here?<<CRLF>>
#10100FFirst and foremost, allow me to ex-<<CRLF>>tend my most heartfelt apologies for<<CRLF>>the actions of my fellow soldiers.
#10105FI realize no apology could possibly be<<CRLF>>sufficient given the circumstances, but<<CRLF>>I do beg your forgiveness nonetheless.
#00408FWh-what's going on here?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FI've heard rumors of you, Griselda.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FNormally, one would not expect to find a<<CRLF>>woman of noble standing like yourself in<<CRLF>>a place such as this...
#10105FYou are well informed, I see.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FHowever, I have difficulty understanding<<CRLF>>your actions. First you shell our town, and<<CRLF>>then you come to apologize?
#10101FYou are correct that Gruda is an officer<<CRLF>>sent by Romn, and part of the Romun<<CRLF>>Army.
#10104FHowever, his orders were to investigate<<CRLF>>the Primeval Lands and report back to us<<CRLF>>with his findings. Nothing more.
#10101FHis actions here were in no way<<CRLF>>sanctioned by Romn.<<CRLF>>
#10002FWhat? A soldier not obeying orders?!<<CRLF>>How disgraceful!<<CRLF>>
#10105FCommander Leo, you will continue fol-<<CRLF>>lowing the movements of Gruda and his<<CRLF>>men, and report back to me.
#10100FPursue them as deep into the Great Forest<<CRLF>>as is necessary.<<CRLF>>
#10002FY-yes, ma'am!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FNow, Mayor Aaron...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FI realize this may startle the people of<<CRLF>>Highland, and for that I apologize, but I<<CRLF>>would like to station my soldiers here.
#00408FWha...?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FWe cannot have the existence of Highland<<CRLF>>becoming common knowledge outside the<<CRLF>>Great Forest.
#10100FAs such, I would like soldiers of my army<<CRLF>>to stand guard between here and the river,<<CRLF>>to prevent any further intruders.
#10105FI give you my word that they will cause<<CRLF>>no harm to the people of Highland under<<CRLF>>any circumstances.
#14205FSo, that's the situation, is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FGrandfather...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14205FVery well. You have my blessing in this.<<CRLF>>Do as you wish.<<CRLF>>
#10105FI am grateful for your understanding.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10100FAs for you, Adol Christin...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10105FYou are free to continue your journey.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Huh?!
Is this some kind of trap?
#10103FI don't recall ever canceling your out-<<CRLF>>standing task to complete a map of<<CRLF>>the Great Forest, after all...
#10103FHaha. There is no need to be on guard.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10103FI feel that you are a vital piece of the<<CRLF>>puzzle that is currently unfolding in this<<CRLF>>region.
#10103FAnd with even a single piece missing, the<<CRLF>>puzzle cannot be completed...<<CRLF>>
Thank you for coming.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Did you see my quest on the board?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FYes. That's why we're here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWhat is it you'd like us to do, exactly?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FOh! I'm sorry, I haven't seen it yet.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FIs there something we can help you with?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Actually, I'd like you to defeat a group of<<CRLF>>guardians.<<CRLF>>
#00401FGuardians? What do you mean, exactly?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Tower guardians. You know. They're fine if they<<CRLF>>remain inside the tower...<<CRLF>>
But for some reason, possibly because of the<<CRLF>>storms abating, several of them have wandered<<CRLF>>out into the Sanctuary.
They haven't gotten too far just yet, but they<<CRLF>>have gone...a bit haywire.<<CRLF>>
I can't imagine they'd trek all the way to<<CRLF>>the town, but it's not a risk I'm willing to<<CRLF>>take.
There's no hurry, so you can take care of this<<CRLF>>request whenever you get the opportunity.<<CRLF>>Assuming you're willing to help, that is.
#00401FOf course! Leave it to us.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FRight, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you very much.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The guardians in question look a lot like<<CRLF>>Inslapes, but there will be some visible<<CRLF>>differences.
They're also likely to be much stronger than the<<CRLF>>Inslapes you've encountered in the tower before.<<CRLF>>
I confirmed five of them in total. They prefer<<CRLF>>to attack in groups, so if you can defeat them<<CRLF>>all, the problem will be solved.
Thank you again, and do take care.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CThe quest 'Wayward Guardians' has been\nadded to your journal.
You managed to defeat the guardians? Thank<<CRLF>>you so much!<<CRLF>>
It's not a lot, but please accept this for your<<CRLF>>efforts.<<CRLF>>
#00411FHeh. And it wouldn't have been possible<<CRLF>>if not for my elegant combat skills.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You've become a lot stronger recently.<<CRLF>>And in such a short amount of time, too!<<CRLF>>
#00401FR-really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Absolutely. Of course, you can't let that get<<CRLF>>to your head.<<CRLF>>
You've got plenty more growing to do. I'm sure<<CRLF>>you can become even stronger by following the<<CRLF>>example of Adol and his friends.
#00403FThank you. I will!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Wayward Guardians'!
#14000FHee, how was Calilica's tour of the town?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FI'm going to be teaching a small lesson<<CRLF>>for the children shortly. <<CRLF>>
#14000FCalilica will be helping me, too. It's not<<CRLF>>much, but I hope they find it useful in their<<CRLF>>daily lives.
#14000FPlease don't concern yourself with me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FTake your time and enjoy all the services<<CRLF>>and sights this town has to offer.<<CRLF>>
#14000FIf anything happens, I'll be sure to let you<<CRLF>>know.<<CRLF>>
Oh, you must be...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FGood day, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FDid you manage to get any sleep after<<CRLF>>we spoke last night?<<CRLF>>
I did, thank you.
Not a wink.
#14003FHeehee. I'm glad to hear that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FErr... Are you Leeza, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FOh dear, that's a bit worrisome!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThat's what happens when you go<<CRLF>>wandering around town in the middle<<CRLF>>of the night, Adol.
#14003FHeehee.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FSo...are you Leeza, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FYou're very pretty.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FHeh. Isn't she, though?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FLeeza is the most popular maiden in all<<CRLF>>of Highland. And for good reason!<<CRLF>>
#14012FM-most popular?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FWhy are you boasting about her?<<CRLF>>Shouldn't you be, like, jealous or<<CRLF>>something?
Haha. These two have always been very close<<CRLF>>to one another.<<CRLF>>
They've been raised together as if they were<<CRLF>>sisters.<<CRLF>>
#00305FI see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FAnd who might you be?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself yet!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My name is Mariana. I'm one of the Apostles of<<CRLF>>Highland.<<CRLF>>
#00309FApostles?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FOh, that's right, I haven't explained that<<CRLF>>yet, have I?<<CRLF>>
#00400FThose who directly serve Lord Eldeel are<<CRLF>>referred to as his 'Apostles.'<<CRLF>>
#00405FAnd only Apostles are allowed to enter<<CRLF>>the tower where he lives.<<CRLF>>
#00400F...Of course, there's more to it than that,<<CRLF>>but that's the general gist. Suffice it to<<CRLF>>say, it's a very important position.
#00403FLeeza is an Apostle too, and...so am I,<<CRLF>>but I'm just an apprentice.<<CRLF>>
#00200FOh, really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FImportant position, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo...how do these Apostles serve your<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel, exactly?<<CRLF>>
Well, each of the Apostles has a different task<<CRLF>>assigned to him or her.<<CRLF>>
Mine, for example, is the Rite of Prophecy,<<CRLF>>in which I convey the words of Lord Eldeel to<<CRLF>>the people of Highland.
Leeza's role, then...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FMy role is called the Rite of Summoning.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThe Rite of Summoning? If I recall<<CRLF>>correctly, the mayor spoke of that<<CRLF>>yesterday.
#00105FAdol said something about Lord Eldeel<<CRLF>>giving knowledge to people of his choosing.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo does that mean your role is to bring<<CRLF>>those people here?<<CRLF>>
#14000FExactly.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FYou probably figured this out by now,<<CRLF>>but...<<CRLF>>
#00411FThe one who brought Adol to this town<<CRLF>>before he lost his memories was Leeza.<<CRLF>>
#00209FR-really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FCome to think of it, what happened to<<CRLF>>the person you were supposed to be<<CRLF>>bringing here this time?
#00400FWas...he? with you when you returned<<CRLF>>last night?<<CRLF>>
#14000FNo, actually.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FLord Eldeel indicated that the timing was<<CRLF>>no longer convenient, so I was asked to<<CRLF>>cancel the summoning until a later date.
#00409FReally? That's a shame. But, if Lord<<CRLF>>Eldeel wasn't able to grant an audience,<<CRLF>>then that's that, I suppose.
#00400FHe must be really busy right now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FYes...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Are you okay, Leeza? You seem tired.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Perhaps you should avoid making any more long<<CRLF>>journeys for the time being.<<CRLF>>
#14000FNo, I'm fine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, if you're sure...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FAll right, everyone, I think we should<<CRLF>>move on to the next location.<<CRLF>>
#14000FI really am fine, Calilica. You needn't<<CRLF>>worry so much about it.<<CRLF>>
#00203FEveryone needs to rest sometimes!<<CRLF>>It's nothing to be ashamed of.<<CRLF>>
#00305FIndeed. We have heard enough for now.<<CRLF>>Any further questions can wait. Thank<<CRLF>>you very much for your time.
#00100FTake care. It's nice meeting you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FOkay, Ms. Tour Guide, lead the way!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FHmph. Don't patronize me, neck-chin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FCome on, everyone, let's move along!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FOh, hello. Are you still exploring the<<CRLF>>town?<<CRLF>>
#00400FI know you've been warned already,<<CRLF>>but make sure not to leave through the<<CRLF>>north exit. It's pretty much the only rule.
The guardians in question look a lot like<<CRLF>>Inslapes, but there will likely be visible<<CRLF>>differences.
They are also likely to be much stronger than<<CRLF>>the Inslapes you've encountered in the tower<<CRLF>>previously.
I confirmed five of them in total. They prefer<<CRLF>>to attack in groups, so if you can defeat them<<CRLF>>all, the problem will be resolved.
Thank you again, and do take care.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you again for helping me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Please take care on your journey.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
So far, we're continuing to mask the truth about<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel by saying that he's just taken ill.<<CRLF>>
But I don't know how much longer we'll be<<CRLF>>able to keep it up before people start getting<<CRLF>>suspicious. Some already have.
I'd like to wait a little longer and see how the<<CRLF>>situation develops, but I'm just not sure we<<CRLF>>can...
I've heard the two explorers who arrived here<<CRLF>>recently are heading deeper into the forest.<<CRLF>>
If the Sanctuary of Storms were functioning<<CRLF>>properly, they'd be forced to return here...<<CRLF>>but now that it's been disabled...
...I just hope nothing happens to them.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If the Sanctuary of Storms were functioning<<CRLF>>properly, those two explorers would be forced to<<CRLF>>return here...but now that it's been disabled...
...I just hope nothing happens to them.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The Romun forces stationed here seem to be<<CRLF>>genuine, well-meaning people.<<CRLF>>
I suppose that's a result of Governor General<<CRLF>>Griselda's virtuous nature.<<CRLF>>
Still, I feel guilty keeping the truth about<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel from the people here.<<CRLF>>
The mayor is right in saying that it wouldn't be<<CRLF>>a good idea to tell them, but that does nothing<<CRLF>>to clear my conscience.
Still, it brings me great joy to see you alive<<CRLF>>and well, Adol.<<CRLF>>
Your memory loss is a little worrying, but for<<CRLF>>now, just try and take good care of yourself.<<CRLF>>
Ever since the Romun army arrived, we haven't<<CRLF>>heard a word from Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
...Is he really all right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The mayor said he'll be able to give us a more<<CRLF>>detailed report soon, but all this secrecy is<<CRLF>>just making me fear the worst.
Is Lord Eldeel really all right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The mayor said he'll be able to give us a more<<CRLF>>detailed report soon, but all this secrecy is<<CRLF>>just making me fear the worst.
The Apostle Leeza hasn't returned to town for<<CRLF>>quite some time.<<CRLF>>
Could Lord Eldeel's illness really have<<CRLF>>become so grave that it requires her<<CRLF>>constant attention?
I pray that's not the case.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* This town really has changed lately.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I still half expect to wake up and find it was<<CRLF>>all a dream.<<CRLF>>
Violating the Sanctuary and attacking the<<CRLF>>town... Blasphemy against Lord Eldeel,<<CRLF>>all of it!
I have no doubts that their actions are<<CRLF>>responsible for Lord Eldeel's ill health.<<CRLF>>
Do they have no morals at all?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I have no doubts that those soldiers' actions<<CRLF>>are responsible for Lord Eldeel's ill health.<<CRLF>>
Do they have no morals at all?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, so you're the red-headed explorer and his<<CRLF>>companions people have been talking about?<<CRLF>>
Well, while you're here...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You should pray to Lord Eldeel as well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, while you're here...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You should pray to Lord Eldeel as well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Lord Eldeel...please bestow upon us your divine<<CRLF>>guidance...<<CRLF>>
Lord Eldeel... I pray that you recover as soon<<CRLF>>as possible...<<CRLF>>
Lord Eldeel... I pray that you can rest<<CRLF>>peacefully today...<<CRLF>>
Lord Eldeel... I pray that your return to good<<CRLF>>health comes as soon as possible...<<CRLF>>
Lord Eldeel... Please watch over me today as<<CRLF>>you always have...<<CRLF>>
#00105F...But...why...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CDuren is mumbling in his sleep.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205F...Oh, is dinner ready...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00206FMmmmm...so much meat... <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>*mumblemumble*<<CRLF>>
#4CKarna is sleeping contentedly.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4COzma is sleeping peacefully.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14205FThe townsfolk are slowly beginning to<<CRLF>>realize the truth about Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#14205FI won't be able to delay the full revel-<<CRLF>>ation for much longer. But now is not<<CRLF>>quite the time.
#14200FI'll continue to see how events play out,<<CRLF>>while hoping for the best from you. I<<CRLF>>wish you Godspeed, Adol Christin.
#14200FI leave Lord Eldeel and Leeza in your<<CRLF>>hands. Please do what you can.<<CRLF>>
#14200FI'll continue to see how events play out,<<CRLF>>while hoping for the best from you. I<<CRLF>>wish you Godspeed, Adol Christin.
#14200FI leave Lord Eldeel and Leeza in your<<CRLF>>hands. Please do what you can.<<CRLF>>
#14200FThe Celcetan Army soldiers stationed here<<CRLF>>act reasonably. They perform their duties<<CRLF>>while showing us every consideration.
#14200FIt seems that Governor General Griselda is<<CRLF>>truly an individual worthy of our trust.<<CRLF>>
#14205F...However, there are still many in<<CRLF>>the Romun Army who are not as well-<<CRLF>>intentioned as she.
#14200FAs the mayor of this town, it is my duty<<CRLF>>to be prepared for any possibility.<<CRLF>>
#14200FI will do all I can, just as you are doing<<CRLF>>all you can for us.<<CRLF>>
#14200FIt is my duty as mayor to think about<<CRLF>>how best to lead this town.<<CRLF>>
#14200FGreetings, Calilica. Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FDo you have something to report?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FI'm afraid so.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CCalilica told Aaron about everything that had transpired in Danan.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14205F...I see. So that's what happened to Lord<<CRLF>>Eldeel...<<CRLF>>
#14205FAs for Leeza...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FUmm... Grandfather? Did you know about<<CRLF>>Leeza?<<CRLF>>
#14200FThat she was a descendant of King<<CRLF>>Lefance? Yes, I did.<<CRLF>>
#14200FBut that was all I knew.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200F...It doesn't sound like you have the time<<CRLF>>to be standing here talking to me. <<CRLF>>
#14200FPlease continue to support Leeza as best<<CRLF>>as you can, Adol. And Calilica as well.<<CRLF>>
#14205FI'm ashamed that I must depend on you<<CRLF>>for this matter, but you truly are our only<<CRLF>>hope.
#00401FGrandfather...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FDon't worry. Leave it to us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200F...The situation seems to be getting more<<CRLF>>serious by the day.<<CRLF>>
#14200FPlease take care, all of you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FAnd please continue to look after<<CRLF>>Calilica, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#14200FAs for Lord Eldeel's disappearance...I<<CRLF>>would appreciate it if you'd keep that a<<CRLF>>secret from the townsfolk.
#14200FFor now, I've informed everyone<<CRLF>>that Lord Eldeel has taken ill and will be<<CRLF>>resting until he recovers.
#14200FIf I were to reveal the entire truth right<<CRLF>>now, it would create mass confusion<<CRLF>>and panic.
#14200F...Take care. I will be praying for your<<CRLF>>safety.<<CRLF>>
#14200FPlease watch over Calilica.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200F...Take care. I will be praying for your<<CRLF>>safety.<<CRLF>>
#14200FI believe Calilica is currently at the chapel.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14200FYou're welcome to look around the town,<<CRLF>>but please try to avoid drawing too much<<CRLF>>attention to yourselves.
#14200FWalking around freely in a monsterless<<CRLF>>environment should be a pleasant change<<CRLF>>of pace for you. Or so I'd hope.
#14200FSo please try to use the time meaning-<<CRLF>>fully.<<CRLF>>
Governor General Griselda seems to be going to<<CRLF>>great pains to keep the existence of this town<<CRLF>>a secret from Romn.
We have to do all we can as well to keep<<CRLF>>information from leaking out.<<CRLF>>
Not only did they escape from the room, they<<CRLF>>managed to escape from the town completely!<<CRLF>>Can't believe they pulled it off.
Grrr... When I get my hands on them...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Two explorers who managed to get here<<CRLF>>through the Underground Ruins have been<<CRLF>>detained in a room on the second floor.
Be careful not to let them out.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Don't worry. Leave the town to us. We'll keep<<CRLF>>everybody safe here.<<CRLF>>
The Governor General's orders were to<<CRLF>>behave respectably, with all due courtesy<<CRLF>>toward the people of this town.
If you think about it, the level of technology<<CRLF>>here would allow these people to produce some<<CRLF>>very powerful weapons if they wanted to.
Not that anyone here WOULD want to...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If Romn were to find out about this town, I'm<<CRLF>>sure the government would want to take control<<CRLF>>of it by force.
It's our duty to make sure that doesn't happen.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If Romn were to find out about this town,<<CRLF>>I'm sure the government would want to take<<CRLF>>control of it by force.
It's our duty to make sure that doesn't happen.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I was just trying to give them their meal when<<CRLF>>they charged out of the room and burst out<<CRLF>>through the back door.
The sheer power behind their escape was<<CRLF>>remarkable. I was blown away!<<CRLF>>
I wonder what we should do with those two<<CRLF>>explorers...<<CRLF>>
Now that they know of this town's existence,<<CRLF>>we can't just let them go.<<CRLF>>
I never imagined we'd find a modern-looking<<CRLF>>town like this in the farthest reaches of the<<CRLF>>Great Forest.
Honestly, even standing here, I have trouble<<CRLF>>believing it's real.<<CRLF>>
#4CThe door is locked, but voices can be heard from within the room.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Female Voice
#0MCome on! Why did they lock us in here?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MThe Romuns have no right to treat us like this!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#0MCalm down?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MHow about you rile up instead?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MStop wasting time trying to calm me down,<<CRLF>>and start focusing on thinking of a way<<CRLF>>to get us out of here!
Male Voice
#2MB-but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Female Voice
#0MWhat? If you've got a problem, then we can<<CRLF>>just go our separate ways right here and now!<<CRLF>>
Male Voice
#2M...Fine, fine. I'm thinking, I'm thinking!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe door is locked, but voices can be heard from<<CRLF>>within the room.<<CRLF>>
#4CThey seem to be discussing methods of escape.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CIt seems this door is a strange variety that can't be unlocked from<<CRLF>>inside.<<CRLF>>
#4CThis is Aaron's room. It would be rude to enter without<<CRLF>>permission.<<CRLF>>
#4CThis is Calilica's room. It would be rude to enter without<<CRLF>>permission.<<CRLF>>
#00309FWhat an impressive building...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FIt sure is pretty...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FThis is the chapel, where people offer<<CRLF>>prayers to Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#00400FLook, it's Mariana and Leeza, talking by<<CRLF>>the altar!<<CRLF>>
#00403FHow about we go say hi?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp4203m.JSON_TEXT 14 >>
#14000FCalilica, this is Adol Christin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FHe came here from Esteria.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FEsteria? 'Devil's Tower' Esteria?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FLord Eldeel did say it had been freed by<<CRLF>>a traveler who arrived here recently, but...<<CRLF>>
#00401F...There's no way...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14003FHeehee. You wanted to meet him, didn't<<CRLF>>you?<<CRLF>>
#00405FI-I didn't say anything about wanting to<<CRLF>>meet him!<<CRLF>>
#00401FGeez, from the way Lord Eldeel<<CRLF>>described him, I was expecting some-<<CRLF>>body a lot stronger-looking than this...
#14000FAdol, Calilica is very interested in the<<CRLF>>outside world.<<CRLF>>
#14000FMuch information finds its way here,<<CRLF>>but few of us get the chance to leave the<<CRLF>>town and see the world for ourselves.
#14000FI'd greatly appreciate it if you'd let Calilica<<CRLF>>hear about some of your adventures.<<CRLF>>
#00400FLeeza...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FFor now, though, I'm afraid I must go<<CRLF>>and report to Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#14003FIn the meantime, I'll leave you two to<<CRLF>>become better-acquainted.<<CRLF>>

#00211FWhew... We finally made it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FI could feel the hairs on the back of my<<CRLF>>neck standing up every time lightning<<CRLF>>was about to strike. That was scary...
#00300F...So, what now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FThere's an elevator nearby that will take<<CRLF>>us up to Lord Eldeel's room.<<CRLF>>
#00400FWe should head there right away.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FThis is such a strange place...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FWhat are those things below us?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411F*ahem* They're the mechanisms that<<CRLF>>control the Sanctuary's storms!<<CRLF>>
#00100FOh, really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...Wait, seriously?! Those things...are<<CRLF>>what make those crazy storms we just<<CRLF>>passed through?!
#00401FYep! Lord Eldeel uses them to directly<<CRLF>>control the rain and thunderstorms in<<CRLF>>the Sanctuary.
#00401FAnd the rain from the Sanctuary flows<<CRLF>>into the river, which is responsible for<<CRLF>>the rapid currents on this side.
#00400FSo in a way, you could say they spin<<CRLF>>to help protect these Primeval Lands<<CRLF>>from any who would do them harm!
#00309FTruly the work of a god...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FWe've been told that Lord Eldeel came<<CRLF>>from a distant land on the other side<<CRLF>>of the ocean a long, long time ago.
#00401FAnd he modeled these mechanisms<<CRLF>>after a weather-controlling device that<<CRLF>>existed there.
#00109FWow...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FOver there's the elevator that will take<<CRLF>>us to his room.<<CRLF>>
#00411FHop aboard, everyone!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409F...H-huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402FWoooork!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FWhat's wrong?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FThe elevator doesn't seem to be working.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FTh-this has never happened before...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FIs there any other way up?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FWell, yes, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112F...Please don't say that staircase...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FI'm sure it would be wonderful exercise,<<CRLF>>but I wouldn't really recommend it as<<CRLF>>anything other than a last resort.
#00300FThere seem to be...a variety of monsters<<CRLF>>patrolling these platforms, too.<<CRLF>>
#00401FThose are the tower's guardians.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FLooks like we'll have to get past them if<<CRLF>>we want to win ourselves an audience<<CRLF>>with Lord Eldeel.
What happened here?
We can't turn back now.
#00404FI-I don't know...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FI don't want to think about it, but there's<<CRLF>>always the chance that something terrible<<CRLF>>may have happened to Lord Eldeel.
#00401FAdol, I'm worried! I'd really like to go<<CRLF>>see him and...make sure he's okay.<<CRLF>>
#00305FIndeed not. Were we to leave the tower<<CRLF>>now, all this effort would be for naught.<<CRLF>>
#00111FYeah, we've come too far to go back<<CRLF>>empty-handed. Let's do this!<<CRLF>>
#00404FI'm worried something may have<<CRLF>>happened to Lord Eldeel...<<CRLF>>
#00401FP-please let me come with you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FOkay, then...let's go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F*whistle* This is so much more convenient<<CRLF>>than those damned stairs. Wish we could've<<CRLF>>used this on the way up, too.
#00101FWonder what made it stop working...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FI still have no idea.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FI can't imagine Lord Eldeel would shut it<<CRLF>>off himself...<<CRLF>>
#00201F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...Karna, can you sense it too?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FYeah. We're not alone in here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FOh, don't say that. We really don't have<<CRLF>>time to be hanging around here anymore.<<CRLF>>

#00402F#16SLord Eldeel!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FWhere are you?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00412F...And why is this room such a mess<<CRLF>>again?! Sheesh!<<CRLF>>
#00412FHonestly, Leeza is kind enough to tidy up,<<CRLF>>but we take our eyes off him for a few<<CRLF>>minutes and it's back to how it was!
#00209FHe sure has a lot of books...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FSo this is the room Adol was invited to.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThere do seem to be a whole lot of things<<CRLF>>in here that I've...never seen before...<<CRLF>>
#00309FSo all of this is knowledge that Eldeel<<CRLF>>intends to give to others?<<CRLF>>
#00300FI wonder what he planned to impart upon<<CRLF>>Adol...<<CRLF>>
#00100FWe can ask him if we find him! Come<<CRLF>>on. He's gotta be around here somewhere,<<CRLF>>right?

#14000FI'm terribly sorry to have kept you<<CRLF>>waiting, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#14000FLord Eldeel is expecting you on the<<CRLF>>balcony. Please, come this way.<<CRLF>>
#14100FExcuse me, Leeza.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001F*stare*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14109FI-I'm sorry for the mess.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000F...I'll tidy the room again later.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FIf you wish to talk to Adol here, I'll take<<CRLF>>my leave now.<<CRLF>>
#14103FThank you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14105FNow, Adol. All of these books and blue-<<CRLF>>prints you see before you...<<CRLF>>
#14100FThey all depict things that I plan to have<<CRLF>>someone invent one day.<<CRLF>>
Plan to have someone invent?
Unbelievable...
#14100FIndeed. One day, someone will invent<<CRLF>>each of the inventions you see before<<CRLF>>you.
#14100FYour surprise is completely natural, but<<CRLF>>I suppose you could say that this is my job.<<CRLF>>
#14106FConstruction, arts, medicine, weaponry...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FAll kinds of knowledge from every field of<<CRLF>>study are gathered here for the express<<CRLF>>purpose of gifting to mankind one day.
#14100FAnd by bestowing this knowledge, I have<<CRLF>>worked to maintain balance and harmony<<CRLF>>in the world throughout its history.
Throughout its history?
Sounds like the work of a god...
#14100FThat's right. Recent history, in any case.<<CRLF>>I've repeated this process for several<<CRLF>>centuries, ever since I came to this land.
#14103FHaha. There are many in Highland who<<CRLF>>regard me as one.<<CRLF>>
#14100FI have been carrying out this process for<<CRLF>>hundreds of years now, treating it as my<<CRLF>>sacred duty.
#14105FWhen a land struggled with floods, I gave<<CRLF>>its people the knowledge to build flood-<<CRLF>>gates and improve irrigation.
#14105FIn one age, a violent plague spread across<<CRLF>>the land, and I prompted the development<<CRLF>>of a cure.
#14100FAs for a recent example...ah, do you see<<CRLF>>that blueprint spread out over there?<<CRLF>>
Where?
What's it a blueprint of?
#14109FAh, I'm sorry. I have a habit of being a<<CRLF>>little...untidy.<<CRLF>>
#14101FI believe there are blueprints of a boat on<<CRLF>>this table.<<CRLF>>
#14103FObserve for yourself.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FNot long ago, I showed those blueprints<<CRLF>>to a certain engineer.<<CRLF>>
#14105F...The armies of the Romun Empire and<<CRLF>>the Principality of Altago have long been<<CRLF>>butting heads, as I'm sure you know.
#14105FAt one point, Altago seemed to be at a<<CRLF>>disadvantage. But now, the two forces are<<CRLF>>an even match for one another.
#14100FThe reason for this sudden equalization?<<CRLF>>An exceptionally fast warship the Altaginians<<CRLF>>happened to invent in the nick of time.
I wanna ride on one! Pleeeease?
And these are its blueprints?
#14103FHaha. As expected of an explorer like you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FMy point, however, is that these blueprints<<CRLF>>are the plans for that very warship.<<CRLF>>
#14100FIndeed. Very perceptive of you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FThat is precisely what these are.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14105FThe countries have been at odds for<<CRLF>>so long, it would create an imbalance<<CRLF>>were one to fall under the other's flag.
#14101FIf Romn were to annex Altago, the num-<<CRLF>>ber of problems for both nations would<<CRLF>>increase considerably.
#14101FIt simply would not be wise to let the<<CRLF>>war end quite so easily.<<CRLF>>
#14101FMuch like the relationships between people,<<CRLF>>resolutions can sometimes lead to problems<<CRLF>>all their own.
#14105FAltago is a particularly complex region,<<CRLF>>and is generally best left to its own de-<<CRLF>>vices. But, exceptions must be made...
#14109FAh, I thought you might be interested in<<CRLF>>this sphere.<<CRLF>>
#14103FUnfortunately, I cannot tell you anything<<CRLF>>about that at the moment. It would...spoil<<CRLF>>all the fun.
#14100FBut I have a feeling that one day you<<CRLF>>will discover the truth behind it on your<<CRLF>>own.
#14100FAnd I do not intend to rob you of that<<CRLF>>joy.<<CRLF>>
#14100F...You are the first person to ask me so<<CRLF>>many questions.<<CRLF>>
#14103FMy body is not supposed to feel<<CRLF>>exhaustion, and yet somehow, I think I'm<<CRLF>>beginning to understand what it's like.
#14000FI've brought some tea. Would you like to<<CRLF>>have a rest now?<<CRLF>>
#14100FThank you, Leeza.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FU-um...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FCould I trouble you to help me carry the<<CRLF>>tea, Adol?<<CRLF>>
#14100F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14106FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FLord Eldeel? Is something the matter?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14103FOh, no, I was just thinking that the two<<CRLF>>of you go together quite well.<<CRLF>>
#14012F#16SWh...wh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FBut Adol seems to have quite a wide<<CRLF>>pool of interests.<<CRLF>>
#14103FAs your father figure, I would be a bit<<CRLF>>worried that he might neglect the<<CRLF>>household.
#14010F#16SP-please, Lord Eldeel, don't tease<<CRLF>>me like that!<<CRLF>>
#14103FHaha. My apologies.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14109FI see... That is a shame.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14101FI was hoping I could count on you as the<<CRLF>>one to discover a route to the western<<CRLF>>world, represented by Europe...
#14101F...and to the eastern world, which remains<<CRLF>>an as of yet uncharted territory.<<CRLF>>
#14106FI had never expected to hear an eighteen-<<CRLF>>year-old say that he wished to explore<<CRLF>>the entire world alone...without shortcuts.
#14100FNow I feel hesitant to ask anyone else.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100F...Well then, Adol, if I cannot impart know-<<CRLF>>ledge upon you, will you at least allow<<CRLF>>me to give you a name?
#14100FNaturally, I don't mean an actual name,<<CRLF>>as you have a fine one of those already.<<CRLF>>I simply wish to give you a title.
#14106FI'm certain that your limitless curiosity<<CRLF>>will grant dreams to the people you<<CRLF>>meet as you travel the world.
#14105FLet me see... What word would be most<<CRLF>>appropriate to describe a remarkable<<CRLF>>individual such as yourself?
#14103FHow about...'Adventurer'?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4C- About Clear Data -
#4CAfter saving clear data, you can load it from\nthe title screen, allowing you to start a new\ngame with your current party progression.
#4C- About New Game+ and Time Attack -

#4CA strange sphere slowly rotates in place.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe pattern on it looks like a map, but built out of puzzle pieces.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CIt appears to be some kind of telescope, though larger in size than<<CRLF>>any that are known, and with a very delicate-looking lens.<<CRLF>>
#4CSome kind of measuring instrument is laid down haphazardly next<<CRLF>>to it.<<CRLF>>
#4CThere are various books piled upon one another here, all pertaining<<CRLF>>to the study of language.<<CRLF>>
#4CAmong them are some with writing in an unrecognizable script.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CVarious antiques, documents and maps are lined up here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThey look like spoils from a ruin raid.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CIt appears to be some kind of ship.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CJudging by the fact that it has a cannon attached to it, it's likely a<<CRLF>>warship.<<CRLF>>
#14000FI'm terribly sorry to have kept you<<CRLF>>waiting, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#14000FLord Eldeel is expecting you on the<<CRLF>>balcony. Please, come this way.<<CRLF>>
#14000FAdol, please wait here until the prepa-<<CRLF>>rations are complete.<<CRLF>>
#14000FYou may make yourself comfortable in<<CRLF>>the meantime.<<CRLF>>
#4CApparently, there are some preparations being made. It would<<CRLF>>be best to have a look around the room while waiting.<<CRLF>>
#4CThere appear to be many interesting things in this room. Curiosity<<CRLF>>dictates that one should examine them thoroughly before leaving!<<CRLF>>

#00402F#1M#16SLord Eldeel!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FSo he's...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FHe is the one they call a god.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FI thought you might come, Calilica.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FAnd...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's nice to see you again.
It's nice to finally meet you.
#0MIndeed, it's a pleasure to see you again as<<CRLF>>well, Adol Christin.<<CRLF>>
#0MI am truly relieved to see that you've made it<<CRLF>>back here safely.<<CRLF>>
#0MAdol, I am truly relieved to see that you've<<CRLF>>made it back here safely.<<CRLF>>
#0MNot long has passed since we last met, yet you<<CRLF>>exude an air of strength and confidence that<<CRLF>>far outclasses what I sensed from you prior.
#00401FLord Eldeel, how are you feeling? Leeza<<CRLF>>told us that you were unwell...<<CRLF>>
#14109FI see. So that is how she explained it,<<CRLF>>then?<<CRLF>>
#14100FToday, at the very least, I'm feeling<<CRLF>>wonderful.<<CRLF>>
#14100FSo wonderful that I thought I would come<<CRLF>>outside for a while and enjoy the breeze.<<CRLF>>
#00404FDoes that mean you really were feeling<<CRLF>>sick?<<CRLF>>
#14106FDo you believe Leeza to be keeping<<CRLF>>secrets from you, Calilica?<<CRLF>>
#14100FI know how perceptive you can be, and<<CRLF>>how much genuine concern you hold for<<CRLF>>the well-being of those around you.
#00404F...Y-yeah, I thought she might be hiding<<CRLF>>something...<<CRLF>>
#14100FLeeza's claim is roughly half true, and<<CRLF>>half...understandably false.<<CRLF>>
#14100FMy body is different to that of yours. I<<CRLF>>don't take ill in quite the same manner<<CRLF>>as you.
#00409FSo...are you okay, or aren't you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14105FThe process my body is undergoing right<<CRLF>>now is more...unique than mere sickness.<<CRLF>>
#14101FAnd it is for that reason that I summoned<<CRLF>>Adol here.<<CRLF>>
Me?
What do you mean by 'unique'?
#14110F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14110F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408F...Lord...Eldeel?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14110F#00796VGeh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14110FI hadn't expected this to occur again so<<CRLF>>soon...<<CRLF>>
#14110F#0818V*huff*...*huff*...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14110FPlease...Adol! Calilica! You must stay<<CRLF>>back!<<CRLF>>
#00409FWha...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FWhat's... What's happening?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00308FHis hair and his wings are changing<<CRLF>>color...<<CRLF>>
#00408F...Lord...Eldeel?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14121F#0799VAdol...Christin...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0800VI thank you for sparing me the trouble of<<CRLF>>hunting you down myself...<<CRLF>>
#0801VHaha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16S#0802VHahahahahahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00308FHis tone is different...as though he has<<CRLF>>become a completely different person!<<CRLF>>
#00408FN-no...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14125FNow I will have you return what is<<CRLF>>rightfully mine...<<CRLF>>
#14122F#16SThe Mask of the Sun! Give it back!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FThe Mask...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208F...of the Sun?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14125FYou humans are unworthy to bear such a<<CRLF>>powerful artifact...<<CRLF>>
#14122F#16SOnly I am suited to possess such<<CRLF>>strength!<<CRLF>>
#00102FUgh... This is not good...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2E#447cS...stop this...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14127FGah! You... You never know when to<<CRLF>>give up...<<CRLF>>
#00402F...Lord Eldeel?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FEverything has returned to its<<CRLF>>original hue...<<CRLF>>
#00209FWhat...just happened?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FIt is as if there are two people, or two<<CRLF>>divinities, inhabiting the same body.<<CRLF>>
#00105FThat's gotta be what Leeza saw that had<<CRLF>>her so flustered.<<CRLF>>
#00101FI don't blame her for wanting to keep<<CRLF>>quiet about it...<<CRLF>>
#00300FCould he have always been like this? Or<<CRLF>>perhaps this affliction has only begun<<CRLF>>occurring recently...
#00100FMy money's on a mixture of the two.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FIt's something that hadn't happened for a<<CRLF>>long time, but just started flaring up again.<<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FAh, here they come.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...How's he doing?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FHe's sleeping now. He does look a little<<CRLF>>better, but...<<CRLF>>
#00404F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FAdol, I think this might be too much for<<CRLF>>us to handle right now.<<CRLF>>
#00101FI'm worried about Eldeel, but we need<<CRLF>>to go back to town and talk to the mayor<<CRLF>>or something. Figure out what to...hey...
#00300F...What is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FI smell something...strange...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FI-it's not me, I swear!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FNo, I smell it too. It seems to be riding<<CRLF>>on the wind, from quite a distance away.<<CRLF>>
#00111FQuite a distance, as in...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F...Highland?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIs that...smoke?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOh, no... No way...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102F#16SThat's cannon fire!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FWhat does 'cannon' mean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FWait, are you talking about...the weapons<<CRLF>>used by your military?!<<CRLF>>
#00408FWho could bring something like that all<<CRLF>>the way here? ...No... It couldn't be...<<CRLF>>
#00402FGrandfather! Leeza!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FAdol, Calilica and I reactivated the elevator<<CRLF>>to the bottom floor while we were looking<<CRLF>>after Eldeel.
#00202FWe can use that to get out of here right<<CRLF>>now! Come on!<<CRLF>>
Let's hurry to Highland!
All Present
#18SRight!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp4312m.JSON_TEXT 23 >>
#14105FYou must be Adol Christin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I am.
Who's asking?
#14105FI imagine you were quite shocked to be<<CRLF>>brought here so suddenly.<<CRLF>>
#14106FHaha. Brimming with curiosity, just as a<<CRLF>>boy your age should be! How marvelous...<<CRLF>>
#14100F#0780VOne day, I intend for mankind to take<<CRLF>>to the skies.<<CRLF>>
#14100F#0781VJust like this, on wings of their own<<CRLF>>creation.<<CRLF>>
#14100F#0782VHowever, now is not yet that time. The<<CRLF>>doors must be opened in the proper order.<<CRLF>>
#0MAllow me to introduce myself.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MMy name is Eldeel.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI suppose you could say I'm the one who brings<<CRLF>>harmony to this world...<<CRLF>>
#0MI invited you here to impart knowledge upon<<CRLF>>you, Adol Christin.<<CRLF>>
#0MHowever, as I look at you, I can't help but feel<<CRLF>>some doubt as to whether or not such action<<CRLF>>can be justified.
#0M...Or rather, I suppose you could say I've been<<CRLF>>having these doubts for some time now...<<CRLF>>
#0MPerhaps since before I even came to this land...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Doubts?
What kind of knowledge?
#14101FIndeed. I'm a little embarrassed by my<<CRLF>>own wavering morality, if I may be<<CRLF>>perfectly honest.
#14101FEver the curious one! I have decided<<CRLF>>upon a specific piece of knowledge I<<CRLF>>intend to give you, but...
#14105FHmm... Should I, or shouldn't I?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FFor a long time now, I've watched over<<CRLF>>this world and granted wisdom to its<<CRLF>>people, maintaining harmony and balance.
#14104FI've always seen this as my calling, and<<CRLF>>dutifully performed these actions time and<<CRLF>>again without question.
#14104FI suppose...the windmills of Highland<<CRLF>>would be an appropriate simile for my<<CRLF>>present state of mind...
<< mp5102.JSON_TEXT 2 >>
#4CDefeated the group of Anderaula!
#4CAdol's base DEF increased by 1.
<< mp5201.JSON_TEXT 500 >>
#00408FIs that...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FSo this is the Village of the Wise? It<<CRLF>>looks almost magical from afar.<<CRLF>>
#00209FI never would've expected to find a<<CRLF>>human settlement in a dark place like<<CRLF>>this...
#00401FI'd heard about this village's existence<<CRLF>>in Highland...<<CRLF>>
#00401FBut I never thought I'd have the chance<<CRLF>>to actually see it for myself.<<CRLF>>
#00200FThis is your first time here too, right,<<CRLF>>Adol?<<CRLF>>
Right.
I can't say for sure.
#00400FYeah, if the Sanctuary of Storms were<<CRLF>>still active, we couldn't be here now.<<CRLF>>
#00400FI'm a little nervous entering a strange<<CRLF>>village like this, but let's just introduce<<CRLF>>ourselves and see what happens!
#00412FWhat kind of wishy-washy answer is<<CRLF>>that? Are you looking to get kicked in<<CRLF>>the shins?!
#00411FIf the Sanctuary of Storms were still active,<<CRLF>>we couldn't be here right now. There's no<<CRLF>>way you could've been here before!
#00101F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FWhy so quiet, Duren? You're always<<CRLF>>first to make some comment about<<CRLF>>what's going on. You're Adol's voice!
#00412FThe silent treatment is kind of creepy<<CRLF>>coming from you.<<CRLF>>
#00105F...It's nothing. Let's get going.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FThis really is a strange place.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FIt's in the Primeval Lands just like<<CRLF>>Highland, but the two places couldn't<<CRLF>>be more different.
#00300F...Someone is coming.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who are you?
H-hello...
#00500F#0548V#2MMy name is Frieda. I'm a warrior of this<<CRLF>>village, who retells stories of the ancient<<CRLF>>past.
#00500F#0549V#2MThe village elder sent me to greet you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500F#0547V#2MAre you nervous? Heehee. How adorable!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500F#0548V#2MMy name is Frieda. I'm a warrior of this<<CRLF>>village, who retells stories of the ancient<<CRLF>>past.
#00500F#0550V#2MWelcome, Adol. I know you've had a long<<CRLF>>journey.<<CRLF>>
How do you know my name?
Have I met you before?
#00500F#2MHeehee. I wonder!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500F#2MMaybe you have! What do you think?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00510F#2MA lady needs to have a sense of mystery<<CRLF>>about her, doesn't she?<<CRLF>>
#0976VHmph. I was expecting a tough warrior or<<CRLF>>something, not a kid.<<CRLF>>
#0977VIs he really up to the job? He doesn't look very<<CRLF>>strong...<<CRLF>>
#00511FHuh? Th-that wasn't me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0978VWhere are you looking?! I'm here! Here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15114F#0979VHow rude!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FE-erm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15110FI'm Nina, an alchemically-created fairy. I'm<<CRLF>>Frieda's partner, and the village messenger.<<CRLF>>
#00408FCreated? As in, someone actually made<<CRLF>>you here?!<<CRLF>>
#00209FAnd you're a fairy, no less! I always<<CRLF>>thought fairies were just...well...fairy<<CRLF>>tales!
#00309F...Incredible...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15103FHah! Surprised? I'll bet you are!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15103FAny more questions? I'm in such a good<<CRLF>>mood today, I'll tell you anything you<<CRLF>>wanna know!
#15111FSo what's it gonna be? Frieda's weight?<<CRLF>>Her measurements? Her ex's name?<<CRLF>>I can give you hints, or just say 'em all!
#00511F#01030VN-now wait just a minute, Nina!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15103F#00981VBwahahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00508FI swear, she's always like this...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FAnyway, I... Wait, where were we?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FYou were about to tell us how you know<<CRLF>>Adol's name.<<CRLF>>
#00505F*cough* Oh, right, I guess I was.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FBut I think there's someone else here<<CRLF>>who would be better suited to answer<<CRLF>>that question.
#00512FDon't you agree, Duren?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FW-wait...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00503FIf I explain everything in detail, we'll be<<CRLF>>here for hours.<<CRLF>>
#00500FBut in short, Duren here has been telling<<CRLF>>me all about you.<<CRLF>>
#00500FThis is where he's from, you see.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Karna and Calilica
#18SWhaaaaaaaat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MIt feels like such a long time since I last saw<<CRLF>>you, Duren.<<CRLF>>
#0M...Pff...hahaha! Tell me, what's with that<<CRLF>>hairstyle? You don't actually think it...suits<<CRLF>>you, do you?
#15103F#0MIt's dreadful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FSh-shut up, you two! This is hardly the<<CRLF>>time to be talking about my hair!<<CRLF>>
#00105FAdol, and everyone else too... I'm sorry<<CRLF>>for keeping so many secrets from all<<CRLF>>of you.
How long have you been lying to us?
Why didn't you tell us before?
#00101FEver since I met you in that bar in<<CRLF>>Casnan after you'd lost your memories.<<CRLF>>
#00105FI told you I first met you as an<<CRLF>>information dealer, right? Well...that's<<CRLF>>not actually how it happened.
#00111FI'm... Really, I'm sorry!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FPretty low, Duren!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00405FYou'd better have a good explanation for<<CRLF>>all of this.<<CRLF>>
#00401FAnd don't give me any of that 'you'll<<CRLF>>understand when you're older' crap.<<CRLF>>I'll bite you so hard!
#00305FYou have your reasons, I trust.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FO-of course...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00504FThis is a village where the descendants<<CRLF>>of those who committed an unforgivable<<CRLF>>sin in the distant past live in secret.
#00501FAnd everything that we have done relates<<CRLF>>to that incident.<<CRLF>>
#00300FAn unforgivable sin?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FWhat do you mean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FThe elder is going to explain all of that to<<CRLF>>you very soon.<<CRLF>>
#00500FWe'll take you to his residence now, and<<CRLF>>show you around the village along the<<CRLF>>way.
#00105FYeah. No more secrets. We'll tell you<<CRLF>>everything there.<<CRLF>>
#00412FHmm... Well, I'm intrigued! Come on,<<CRLF>>Adol.<<CRLF>>
#15100FThe elder's house is the one in front of<<CRLF>>the central tower.<<CRLF>>
#00500FIf there is anywhere else you want to<<CRLF>>explore before we get there, just say<<CRLF>>the word.
#15111FLike Frieda's house... *giggle*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00511FCome, now, there's nothing to see there!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FNow, Adol... Shall we be off?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FThis is where the village elder, Vanjo,<<CRLF>>lives.<<CRLF>>
#00111FHe tends to ramble and is kinda...difficult<<CRLF>>to get along with, so you might want to...<<CRLF>>brace yourselves...
#15111FI'm gonna tell him you said that!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FHmph...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FEither way, if there's anywhere else<<CRLF>>you want to see, I suggest we go see<<CRLF>>it before heading inside.
#00510F...So, what'll it be? Heehee... Indecision<<CRLF>>is not becoming in a man, you know!<<CRLF>>
#00500FThis is where Danan's elder, Vanjo, lives.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FIf there's anywhere else you want to see,<<CRLF>>I suggest we go see it before heading<<CRLF>>inside.
#00500FSo, what's it to be? Heehee... Indecision<<CRLF>>is not becoming in a man, you know!<<CRLF>>
Go inside.
Look around elsewhere first.
#00500FAll right, then. Let's go pay Vanjo a visit.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FOh, you have more sightseeing to do?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FWell, then, we can come back here once<<CRLF>>you've finished exploring the village.<<CRLF>>
#00500FThis way, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FThis place is so beautiful... It's the only<<CRLF>>part of the village where sunlight can get<<CRLF>>through, huh?
#00500FIt's the most sacred place in the entirety<<CRLF>>of the Subterranean Forest.<<CRLF>>
#15006FHah! The sun here is far too bright for<<CRLF>>the likes of us.<<CRLF>>
#15000FPerfect for sealing away a certain power-<<CRLF>>ful object, if I must say.<<CRLF>>
#15000FSee for yourselves in that shrine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FBut don't get too close, now! There's a<<CRLF>>real strong barrier keeping it safe.<<CRLF>>
#00209FIs that...? No, it couldn't be...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FIt's a mask!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15005FYep. That there is the Mask of the Sun.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00108FWhat?! What's it doing here?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FI had it removed from Adol's grave.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00110FWhen the hell did you manage that?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FYou were unaware of this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FYeah... *sigh* Why is this village full of<<CRLF>>such terrible people?<<CRLF>>
#00505FCome, now, that's not very fair of you,<<CRLF>>Duren!<<CRLF>>
#00500FIf it had been left there, it may have<<CRLF>>fallen into the hands of someone who<<CRLF>>really shouldn't have it.
#00500FAnd you were so busy saving Adol after<<CRLF>>he fell into that waterfall, you certainly<<CRLF>>couldn't have claimed it...
#15110FYou should be grateful Frieda was<<CRLF>>watching out for you!<<CRLF>>
#00111FBah.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You saved me?
You were there?
#00100FYeah. I was the one who pulled you out<<CRLF>>of the waterfall basin.<<CRLF>>
#00100FI'd...been keeping an eye on you since<<CRLF>>before you fell in.<<CRLF>>
#00101FLord Eldeel was still unstable, groaning in<<CRLF>>agony like when we last met him in the<<CRLF>>tower.
#00100FSo I seized the chance to rescue you and<<CRLF>>somehow carried you all the way back to<<CRLF>>Casnan. Still not sure how I pulled it off!
#15103FI played my part as a messenger, too!<<CRLF>>We all helped in our own way.<<CRLF>>
#00209FSo that's what happened...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FHowever, if Gruda and his allies are<<CRLF>>seeking the mask, they may be in<<CRLF>>the area.
#00300FIs it safe to leave the mask so exposed?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FHah! No need to worry. That shrine's<<CRLF>>guarded by a powerful force field.<<CRLF>>
#15000FIt'd take one hell of a blast to break<<CRLF>>through that.<<CRLF>>
#00401FThis may seem like an obvious question,<<CRLF>>but...what exactly IS the mask?<<CRLF>>
#00300FThe replicas Gruda's men produced<<CRLF>>were used to strengthen the physical<<CRLF>>prowess of the Romun soldiers.
#00204FAnd the masks used in my village did the<<CRLF>>same thing.<<CRLF>>
#15005FPfah! That's just a side effect.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FThe Mask of the Sun really allows<<CRLF>>its wearer to read the Akashic Records,<<CRLF>>where the world's blueprints're recorded.
#00408FThe...Akashic Records?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FI've never heard of such a thing before.<<CRLF>>What do you mean by 'world's blueprints'?<<CRLF>>
#15000FJust what it sounds like. The world's<<CRLF>>structure, its properties, its origins...<<CRLF>>
#15000FEverything that ever happened in the past,<<CRLF>>even every damned thing that'll ever happen<<CRLF>>in the future. All collected in one book.
#00309FWhat...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15006FChild of Highland.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15006FThink for a moment of Lord Eldeel's<<CRLF>>actions and you'll have your answer.<<CRLF>>
#00401FHis actions? You mean giving people<<CRLF>>knowledge...<<CRLF>>
#00408F...Ah!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15005FReading the blueprints of the world,<<CRLF>>using their contents to ration out know-<<CRLF>>ledge and maintain global balance...
#15000FIt's the Mask of the Sun and the Akashic<<CRLF>>Records that make all that possible.<<CRLF>>
#00101FSo Gruda's real objective is...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...the world's blueprints, and the key to<<CRLF>>reading them.<<CRLF>>
#00209FWhere are these Akashic Records located?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FIn the former capital of the Kingdom of<<CRLF>>Celceta, deeper still within the forest.<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah. And that's where Gruda's headed,<<CRLF>>no doubt. It's gotta be.<<CRLF>>
#00401FHe seemed to be mass-producing copies<<CRLF>>of the mask...<<CRLF>>
#00401FDo you think he plans to use those to<<CRLF>>read the Akashic Records?<<CRLF>>
#15001FPfah! He's a talented magician, but<<CRLF>>no mere copy can even come close to<<CRLF>>approximating the works of the gods.
#15001F...It is possible, I bet, that in the process<<CRLF>>of duplicating the mask, he could have<<CRLF>>learned its true purpose.
#15005FIt's because of us that he...and the<<CRLF>>Romuns...came to this land.<<CRLF>>
#00209FWhat do you--?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Man's Voice
#18S#1MElder!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FWhat's the meaning of this?!<<CRLF>>We're busy here, you know!<<CRLF>>
W-well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
A girl showed up, demanding we give her the<<CRLF>>mask...<<CRLF>>
#15001FA girl?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FDon't tell me that sorceress--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Girl's Voice
#1MSo this is where you all went.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15102F#0MI-is that...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408F#16SLeeza?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FWhy are you...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FSo you're the Apostle girl, eh? Surprised<<CRLF>>you found this place.<<CRLF>>
Where have you been?
How did you get here?
#14004FI'm sorry for worrying you, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FHowever, I'm afraid there's no time to<<CRLF>>explain myself right now.<<CRLF>>
#14004FAdol, I...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14005F...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's no time to<<CRLF>>explain myself right now.<<CRLF>>
#15000FYou seem to be in quite the hurry. Why,<<CRLF>>exactly, can't you take a moment to ex-<<CRLF>>plain yourself again?
#15000FYou can't honestly expect us to hand<<CRLF>>you the mask on faith alone, little lady!<<CRLF>>
#14005F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14002FI...I can save Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FLeeza...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FGuess you're not here under orders as<<CRLF>>an Apostle, then.<<CRLF>>
#15001FHow about you at least tell us why you<<CRLF>>need the mask?<<CRLF>>
#15005FAt least then--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14005F#00582VI'm so sorry!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14002F#00634V#16SSOL!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWh-what's going on?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00502F#0M#16SAbove us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208F#16SWh-what is that thing?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15102FI-it's huge...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FIt's...Leeza's...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FI apologize for being forced to take such<<CRLF>>an aggressive approach, but I simply don't<<CRLF>>have time to do this any other way!
#14002F#00623V...Sol, if you'd please!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00108F#16SWha...?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15008FIt can't be...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00502FWe need to subdue it, Duren! Just...<<CRLF>>don't hurt Leeza in the process!<<CRLF>>
#15102FDon't let us down!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102FI know!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...We can't let her break the barrier and<<CRLF>>take the mask, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00101FSorry to ask, but...will you lend us a<<CRLF>>hand?<<CRLF>>
Of course!
All right, but then we're even!
#00102FThanks! Sorry to get you caught up in all<<CRLF>>this!<<CRLF>>
#00100FYou don't need to repay me for anything,<<CRLF>>you idiot...but thanks!<<CRLF>>
#00102FNow come on, let's do this!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CYou can access the menu now to prepare for\nbattle.
#4CTo change party members, use the Party Menu.
#4CEquipment and skills can also be changed.
#00309F...Did we succeed?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FUgh... That was a hell of a battle...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00508FNo...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FI knew it...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402FConventional weapons aren't going to<<CRLF>>work against this thing!<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001F...So it is a Galbalan, then.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14005FI'm sorry, everyone.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14002F#16S...Sol! Do it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00502F#00559VNo! The barrier...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FNow I can finally save Lord Eldeel...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2E#833cHahaha! Well done, little Apostle!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14008F#16SSOL!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15102F#0MFrieda, he's here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501F#0M...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10226F#2MFinally, the Mask of the Sun is mine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001F#0MY-you're...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10224F#2MHahaha. Don't think too poorly of me,<<CRLF>>little Apostle. I kept my word.<<CRLF>>
#10226F#2MI told you where the mask was, but I<<CRLF>>never once promised I'd let you have<<CRLF>>it...
#10220F#2MYou have only your own naivete to<<CRLF>>blame for this!<<CRLF>>
#0M#14001F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FHmph. I should've known.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FYou always did enjoy making a grand<<CRLF>>entrance, Gruda, but is this any way to<<CRLF>>treat your own people?
#00209FWha...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FAre you saying...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15005FSeveral years ago, one of our own broke<<CRLF>>the laws of our village and unraveled<<CRLF>>the secrets our ancestors sealed away.
#15005FThat man fled the village, taking a small<<CRLF>>group of supporters with him, and gave<<CRLF>>himself over to the Romun Empire.
#15001FHis name was Gruda. And he was once a<<CRLF>>magician from Danan.<<CRLF>>
#10220FStay where you are, Adol Christin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10220FGadis, Bami and the Masked Division are<<CRLF>>occupying the village. You wouldn't want <<CRLF>>any...unfortunate accidents, would you?
#00300FHolding your own homeland hostage,<<CRLF>>now? You are despicable.<<CRLF>>
#15102FYou're just as much of a slime as ever!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MHahaha. Unfortunately for you, I bear no<<CRLF>>emotional attachment to this dreary place.<<CRLF>>
#00504F#0M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MHmm... Perhaps it is destiny that I should<<CRLF>>obtain the mask here.<<CRLF>>
#0MIn honor of this occasion, we shall hereby refer<<CRLF>>to ourselves...as Darklings!<<CRLF>>
#10226FCome now, is that really so surprising?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10220FIt's a perfectly fitting name for those<<CRLF>>who've obtained the power of the gods<<CRLF>>through these...unorthodox means.
#00501FGruda... You...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FYou really haven't changed at all, have<<CRLF>>you?<<CRLF>>
What's a 'Darkling'?
What do you mean he hasn't changed?
#00101FOur ancestors referred to themselves as<<CRLF>>'Darklings' when they deceived the gods<<CRLF>>and stole their power.
#15005FHmph. We here in Danan hesitate even<<CRLF>>to say the word. It's considered impure.<<CRLF>>
#00105FBack when he was still in the village,<<CRLF>>Gruda researched the power our ancestors<<CRLF>>stole from the gods.
#00501FThey called themselves...that name...and<<CRLF>>to this day, the word is considered impure.<<CRLF>>It's bad luck to think it, much less say it!
#10221FHmph, the blood of the Darklings flows<<CRLF>>within you as much as it does in me.<<CRLF>>
#10221FNo matter how far you repress it, it's a<<CRLF>>part of you. And it always will be.<<CRLF>>
#00102FGruda!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10220F...Regardless, now that I have what I<<CRLF>>seek, I see nothing more to be gained<<CRLF>>by remaining here.
#10221FAnd though I may not have much attach-<<CRLF>>ment to this place, I suppose it is still my<<CRLF>>home... So I'll leave peacefully, today.
#10221FShould you continue your fruitless<<CRLF>>attempts to stand in my way, however...<<CRLF>>
#10225F...I won't be quite so merciful next time.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00502FW-wait!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10224F#00886VHahaha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10228F#00887V#16SHaaahahahahahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102FUgh, he's gone...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15113F#00986V#16SNyeeeeh!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00504F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404F#00466VLeeza...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FCalilica... Adol... I...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FWhat have I done...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15005F...Well, this has been a hell of a day.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FNo point just standing here, though. Let's<<CRLF>>go back to my place and sort all this out.<<CRLF>>
#14000FI will be going on ahead to Elduke.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FAre you sure you'll be okay on your<<CRLF>>own?<<CRLF>>
#14003FHeehee! I won't be alone. I have Sol with<<CRLF>>me.<<CRLF>>
#14000FAnd there are a few things I'd like to look<<CRLF>>into...<<CRLF>>
#00500FAbout your ancestor, King Lefance?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FYes. I'd like to know what happened to<<CRLF>>King Lefance and Lord Eldeel when the<<CRLF>>Kingdom of Celceta fell.
#14000FIf I can learn even that much, I might be<<CRLF>>able to find some means of returning<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel to normal.
#00100FWell, don't push yourself too hard, okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103F...Not gonna say anything, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
We'll catch up as soon as we can.
I'm sure we'll find a way.
#0MI'll be eagerly awaiting you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MTake care, everyone!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MAdol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MThank you for your assistance, Adol. I know<<CRLF>>that you have more than enough problems<<CRLF>>of your own.
#0MI'm certain that one day you, Eldeel and I will<<CRLF>>all be able to drink tea together once more.<<CRLF>>
#0MAnd I'll be certain to brew the best tea I can<<CRLF>>possibly find!<<CRLF>>
#0M...Goodbye for now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FAnd there she goes...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FFeminine yet courageous... She's a fine<<CRLF>>girl, eh, Ozma?<<CRLF>>
#00310FI-I had no intention of...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15101F*sigh* Men! They're like animals, aren't<<CRLF>>they?<<CRLF>>
#00311FDuren, please...refrain from making such<<CRLF>>comments. The others have begun group-<<CRLF>>ing me with you!
#00500FIt's time we should get moving, Adol.<<CRLF>>We have a lot of ground to cover!<<CRLF>>
#4CFrieda joined the party.
#4CYou can now accept quests in Danan.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You brought an accessory for me? Why, thank<<CRLF>>you!<<CRLF>>
So...which accessory are you going to give me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Show Silver Dragon's Amulet
Show Gold Dragon's Amulet
Show Silver Axe
Show Golden Axe

This is an accessory that prevents 'Curse'<<CRLF>>status, correct?<<CRLF>>

Do you enjoy tormenting people with things<<CRLF>>they can't have? That's very mean, you know.<<CRLF>>
#00400FHmm... This person's name does start<<CRLF>>with the letter 'U.'<<CRLF>>
#00400FFrieda, would you do the honors?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FIt would be my pleasure.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FUrsula, do you have a moment?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FCould I ask you to sign this notebook?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sign? Why?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This isn't some magical contract or something,<<CRLF>>is it?<<CRLF>>
#00504F...I suppose I can see how you might<<CRLF>>suspect that.<<CRLF>>
#00401FActually...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CCalilica explained to Ursula about the Signature Book.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm. Okay.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Why not?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CFilled the 'U' page of the Signature Book!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FThat's perfect.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FThank you very much!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, no problem!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CFilled all the pages of the Signature Book!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
In the end, I believe it's best for people to<<CRLF>>think positive thoughts.<<CRLF>>
Just run head-first into things and trust that<<CRLF>>everything will be okay! ...Well, don't ACTUALLY<<CRLF>>run head-first into anything, of course...
A couple of explorers? I'm honestly impressed<<CRLF>>they managed to get this deep into the forest.<<CRLF>>
That Galbalan was extremely intimidating.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It didn't seem evil, though...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Duren's never been one to refuse a request.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wouldn't want to be that way, myself, but<<CRLF>>I respect him tremendously for his selflessness.<<CRLF>>
I can see what Adan's saying.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It is important to be cautious. But if you're<<CRLF>>too cautious, you'll never get anywhere at all.<<CRLF>>Finding the right balance is...difficult.
They sure don't seem like they have<<CRLF>>what it takes. Pretty amazing, really.<<CRLF>>
So that was one of the Galbalans our ancestors<<CRLF>>created...<<CRLF>>
Supposedly that was a particularly special one.<<CRLF>>But its power is truly amazing.<<CRLF>>
Hahaha. Duren really never changes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I can see why the elder likes him so much.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, if it isn't Duren!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, hey! What'd you bring us?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You went to Comodo and Selray this time,<<CRLF>>riiiight?<<CRLF>>
#00111FI went for work! I didn't have time to<<CRLF>>worry about souvenirs.<<CRLF>>
Whaaat? But you always used to bring them<<CRLF>>back for us!<<CRLF>>
When did you become so cold and unfeeling?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FOh, be quiet!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FI'll remember next time, okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FBesides, this is no time to be<<CRLF>>worrying about things like that!<<CRLF>>

Hand over a good luck accessory
Cancel
So you brought an accessory for me? Why,<<CRLF>>thank you!<<CRLF>>
Let's see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...You don't seem to have anything I can work<<CRLF>>with at all.<<CRLF>>
I want to find happiness. If you find any<<CRLF>>accessories that have that kind of effect,<<CRLF>>please bring one to me.
I don't know what's written in the Akashic<<CRLF>>Records...but I think I'm better off that way.<<CRLF>>
You wouldn't be able to motivate yourself to do<<CRLF>>anything if you already knew how it was going<<CRLF>>to turn out.
Highland's in trouble now that the sanctuary's<<CRLF>>barrier is gone...but so is Danan.<<CRLF>>
I wonder what's going to happen to us...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Gruda is the same crafty devil as ever, using<<CRLF>>others to do his dirty work for him.<<CRLF>>
His magical and tactical abilities are brilliant,<<CRLF>>but knowledge without the means to apply it is<<CRLF>>no better than idiocy.
Welcome to Danan, travelers.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And Duren and Frieda... Thank you for all<<CRLF>>your hard work.<<CRLF>>
Even if you won't be here for long, I hope<<CRLF>>you'll enjoy your time with us.<<CRLF>>
Even if you won't be here for long, I hope<<CRLF>>you'll enjoy your time with us.<<CRLF>>
If you're hungry, I recommend roasted newt.<<CRLF>>Mmmmm, roasted neeeeewt...<<CRLF>>
A frog and a chicken as familiars...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That...doesn't sound very strong.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That's certainly a unique reason to want to<<CRLF>>learn wind magic...<<CRLF>>
Still, I suppose anything that gives you the<<CRLF>>desire for knowledge is a good thing.<<CRLF>>
And Verde really isn't that fat...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But slimming magic... What a novel idea!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
To think Gruda would stoop so low as to use<<CRLF>>the people of his own village as hostages!<<CRLF>>
I'm just glad no one was hurt. That's all that<<CRLF>>matters in the end.<<CRLF>>
*sigh* My daughter's always causing trouble.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
She reminds me of Duren when he was younger.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FMe?! Hold on a minute, I--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FDuren when he was younger, huh?<<CRLF>>...You're going to have to keep a close eye<<CRLF>>on her.
#00111FWhat's that supposed to mean?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. It means exactly what you think.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FWhen you were younger, you were a<<CRLF>>naughty, reckless, simple-minded, naive...<<CRLF>>
#00111FI don't remember being reckless or<<CRLF>>naughty!<<CRLF>>
#00500FOh? But you're not going to deny you<<CRLF>>were simple-minded or naive?<<CRLF>>
#00111FG-grrr...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm sorry, Duren. I wasn't actually intending<<CRLF>>to tease you!<<CRLF>>
Thinking about it, your friend was probably<<CRLF>>more the trouble-causer than you were.<<CRLF>>
I wonder what he's doing now...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
When I grow up, I'm going to become a<<CRLF>>magician and make Verde and Bianco my<<CRLF>>familiars!
I wonder what they'd say if they could talk...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Why can't Bianco fly for very long? He's got<<CRLF>>wings!<<CRLF>>
Oh well. One day, I'll have to learn some wind<<CRLF>>magic and give him a hand!<<CRLF>>
And Verde's getting a bit fat, so he can't jump<<CRLF>>very well.<<CRLF>>
Oh well. One day, I'll have to invent slimming<<CRLF>>magic and make him nice and skinny!<<CRLF>>
Mommy and the other villagers are really strong<<CRLF>>when they fight. It's not fair!<<CRLF>>
Outnumbering us is cowardly!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Run, run!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Or you'll be well done!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00100FThe elder's house is in front of the central<<CRLF>>tower. Let's get going.<<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. But if there's anywhere else<<CRLF>>you'd like to visit first, do feel free!<<CRLF>>
#00409FUmm... Where does this path go?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FAh, erm... It leads to a small shrine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FIt was made to seal away something<<CRLF>>pretty important.<<CRLF>>
#00101FThough the thing it was made to seal<<CRLF>>away's been lost now, so...it's just a<<CRLF>>shrine.
#00505F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FRegardless, I'm sorry, but the elder's<<CRLF>>permission is needed to go any farther<<CRLF>>this way.
#00500FLet's return to the village, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CIt seems the elder's permission is needed to go<<CRLF>>any farther. It would be best to respect his<<CRLF>>wishes.

<< mp5211.JSON_TEXT 651 >>
#00500F#1MI've brought them with me, Elder.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ah, so they're finally here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's nice to meet you.
I have a lot of questions...
Oh, spare me the self-introductions!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I know all about you already, so you'll just be<<CRLF>>wasting your time.<<CRLF>>
Oh, I know what you want to ask already. Don't<<CRLF>>bother saying anything!<<CRLF>>
#0MYou want to know who we are, am I right?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MHah! Well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MWe're a tribe of people who turned their backs<<CRLF>>on the gods and destroyed an entire ancient<<CRLF>>civilization.
#00309F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FWha...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FI-I don't really understand...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15005FIt happened a long time ago, far overseas.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FOur ancestors stole a mighty power from<<CRLF>>the gods and sank their land to the bottom<<CRLF>>of the ocean.
#15001FBut one of those gods -- a certain Lord<<CRLF>>Eldeel, as it were -- forgave their sins and<<CRLF>>secretly brought them here to Celceta.
#00409FDoes that mean your ancestors lived in<<CRLF>>the Kingdom of Celceta?<<CRLF>>
#15001FMm. The Kingdom was full of good,<<CRLF>>honest people, including their benevolent<<CRLF>>king.
#15006FIt was far too nice a place for a tribe of<<CRLF>>sinners like us.<<CRLF>>
#15000FSo our ancestors settled here, underground,<<CRLF>>repenting for their sins and silently watch-<<CRLF>>ing over the Kingdom.
#15005FBut then something terrible happened.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FSomething...terrible?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FThis is a story every man, woman and<<CRLF>>child in this village knows by heart.<<CRLF>>
#15005FLong ago, a winged sage came to Celceta.<<CRLF>>He gave the people wisdom and civilization,<<CRLF>>and in return they revered him as a god.
#15005FBut one day that god began to act with<<CRLF>>cruelty and malice, as if he'd become a<<CRLF>>different being altogether.
#15005FSteadily, these acts of aggression grew<<CRLF>>until one day, he came to destroy the<<CRLF>>kingdom with his power.
#00408FWas... Was that god...?<<CRLF>>It couldn't have been...Lord Eldeel...<<CRLF>>could it?
#15006FSound familiar, Adol? I believe you've<<CRLF>>witnessed something quite similar yourself.<<CRLF>>
#15000FA certain winged acquaintance of yours<<CRLF>>suddenly behaving quite unlike himself<<CRLF>>and attacking without warning...
#00208FNo...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404F...That's...not possible...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FI don't know the cause of this transform-<<CRLF>>ation.<<CRLF>>
#15001FBut the changes in Lord Eldeel's behavior<<CRLF>>now reflect a similar pattern to his past of<<CRLF>>destroying the Kingdom of Celceta.
#15001FSo we decided to keep an eye on him,<<CRLF>>and on those who visited his tower as<<CRLF>>well.
#15001FWe thought that maybe we could be of<<CRLF>>some service to him, if the situation called<<CRLF>>for it.
#00105FThen Adol was called to the tower, and...<<CRLF>>well, down he went!<<CRLF>>
#00300FI see. So you were the one assigned to<<CRLF>>watch over Adol, then?<<CRLF>>
#00111FY-yeah. Listen, Adol, I...I'm sorry for not<<CRLF>>telling you.<<CRLF>>
#00111FThere was just a lot on the line, and it<<CRLF>>was all so... If I gained your trust, I could<<CRLF>>be at your side. I thought it'd be easier.
#00201FIt's hard to blame him, now we've heard<<CRLF>>all that.<<CRLF>>
#00405FYeah. It's kind of a shame, really.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FH-hey!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15006FWell, he was only doing what I ordered<<CRLF>>him to. So don't be too hard on him, now!<<CRLF>>
I suppose we'll let you off.
Having you around was a big help.
#00412FSo that means all this time, you've been<<CRLF>>pretending not to know things, huh?<<CRLF>>Pretty crucial things, too!
#00412FBut at least you're not a bad actor. I<<CRLF>>thought you were actually dumb, but<<CRLF>>you were just playing the part!
#15111FHe's kind of a natural, but if you'd<<CRLF>>known it was an act, you'd've been<<CRLF>>able to tell. He's not thaaat good!
#00503FHeehee. I can't even imagine how<<CRLF>>awkward it must have been.<<CRLF>>
#00105FC-come on, now, that's enough...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FIt's been a big help having you around,<<CRLF>>Duren.<<CRLF>>
#00305FYour behavior has been suspicious on<<CRLF>>occasion.<<CRLF>>
#00305FBut now that we know the truth behind<<CRLF>>your actions, I feel I speak for us all<<CRLF>>when I say we are grateful to have you.
#00401FMm. I think I can forgive you. This time.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104FThanks, everyone.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FAdol, we here in Danan share the same<<CRLF>>objective as you.<<CRLF>>
#15001FTo pursue Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FAnd to that end, there's something I need<<CRLF>>to show you. Would you come outside for<<CRLF>>a moment?
#15000FDon't worry, you'll understand when you<<CRLF>>see it!<<CRLF>>
#15001F...So, young Apostle. What were you<<CRLF>>trying to do with the Mask of the Sun?<<CRLF>>
#00501FGruda implied he said something to you<<CRLF>>about it.<<CRLF>>
#14004FYes. He told me that last time Lord Eldeel<<CRLF>>was behaving strangely, the Mask of the<<CRLF>>Sun was used to calm him.
#14004FAnd so...I...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14005FI'm so sorry...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FThat scumbag!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15005FWell, what's done is done.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FI'm more interested to know that you're<<CRLF>>a descendant of the Celcetan Royal<<CRLF>>Family...aren't you?
#14009FH-how did you...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FLeeza is?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhoa. That's news to me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FThat white Galbalan of yours was the<<CRLF>>dead giveaway.<<CRLF>>
#15000FLegend has it, it was created by King<<CRLF>>Lefance to fend off Lord Eldeel after he<<CRLF>>lost control of himself.
#00109FSo King Lefance and Lord Eldeel fought<<CRLF>>each other?<<CRLF>>
#15005FThat's what they say. Not that there are<<CRLF>>any surviving records to confirm one way<<CRLF>>or the other, of course!
#15001FWhat we do know for certain is that the<<CRLF>>Galbalans were created using a forbidden<<CRLF>>technology our ancestors sealed away.
#15001FKing Lefance was a righteous man, so<<CRLF>>knowing he allegedly resorted to the use<<CRLF>>of such technology shows his unease.
#00504FGuess that explains how it was able to<<CRLF>>destroy the barrier.<<CRLF>>
#14001FHe...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FSol was given to me by my father to<<CRLF>>carry out the Rite of Summoning.<<CRLF>>
#14001FI was told he'd been passed down in the<<CRLF>>family for generations...<<CRLF>>
#14004FBut I had no idea his creation had come<<CRLF>>about under circumstances like that!<<CRLF>>
#00411FYou rode on Sol too, Adol. Leeza used<<CRLF>>him to take you to see Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
Really?
I don't remember...
#14000FYes. Lord Eldeel asked me to escort<<CRLF>>you to his room personally.<<CRLF>>
#14000FAnd I have to say, it was no small task<<CRLF>>finding you out in that forest!<<CRLF>>
#14000FYour memories should return in time.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FI must say, it was rather difficult finding<<CRLF>>you out in that forest!<<CRLF>>
#00111FThis is Adol we're talking about. The guy<<CRLF>>never sits still! He can't even sleep with-<<CRLF>>out sneaking out a window first!
#14003F...Heehee...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FThe thing I find most difficult to accept is<<CRLF>>that the man who attacked Highland was<<CRLF>>from Danan.
#00204FYeah. He had me completely fooled.<<CRLF>>There was no doubt in my mind he<<CRLF>>was a Romun commander.
#15005FGruda was one of the most intelligent<<CRLF>>people in the village.<<CRLF>>
#15001FHe was also a wise man in his day, who<<CRLF>>loathed the sin our ancestors committed<<CRLF>>more than anyone else.
#15001FAnd that hatred drove him to study the<<CRLF>>incident in greater detail.<<CRLF>>
#15001FBut somehow or another, during his stud-<<CRLF>>ies, he became attracted to the power of<<CRLF>>the gods that they'd attempted to steal.
#00309FWhy would that be?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FOnly he knows the answer to that. We<<CRLF>>naturally admonished the hell out of him<<CRLF>>for what he was doing.
#15001FJust out of nowhere he gathered a<<CRLF>>small group of supporters and left the<<CRLF>>village, and that was the end of that.
#15104F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FIn addition to keeping an eye on Lord<<CRLF>>Eldeel, we've also been trying our best<<CRLF>>to track him down all this time.
#00504FMost likely, he managed to gain the<<CRLF>>support of Romn for his research into<<CRLF>>the mask.
#00300FAnd now he has returned to the forest.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FSo where's he headed next?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15005FHe must have sussed out the mask's true<<CRLF>>power by now.<<CRLF>>
#00101FWhich means there's only one thing he<<CRLF>>could possibly be after.<<CRLF>>
#00501FThe Akashic Records. The blueprints of<<CRLF>>the world, which can only be read using<<CRLF>>the mask's power.
#00104FOn the other side of the Ashen Forest is<<CRLF>>the old capital of the Kingdom of Celceta.<<CRLF>>It's called 'Elduke.'
#00104FAnd in its center sits the Temple of the<<CRLF>>Sun, where Lord Eldeel lived when the<<CRLF>>kingdom still existed.
#00101FSupposedly, that's where the Akashic<<CRLF>>Records can be found.<<CRLF>>
#00300F...'Supposedly'?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FThe door of the temple is sealed. We've<<CRLF>>tried to open it many times, but we've<<CRLF>>never been able to get inside.
#00504FSo we can't be certain what's in there.<<CRLF>>But considering his resourcefulness up till<<CRLF>>now, Gruda may have found a way.
#14001FWhen...I was talking with Gruda...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001F...he also mentioned that Lord Eldeel is<<CRLF>>headed for Elduke as well.<<CRLF>>
#15005FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIt seems Elduke is the main point of<<CRLF>>interest for all parties, then.<<CRLF>>
#00203FIncluding you, Adol. If you ever want to<<CRLF>>learn the truth about what happened to<<CRLF>>you, you need to confront Eldeel.
Then that's just what I'll do.
Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!
#00100FElduke, huh? This'll be my first time<<CRLF>>there too.<<CRLF>>
#00111FI'll bet you'd be raring to go even if you<<CRLF>>had all your memories intact, wouldn't you?<<CRLF>>
#00501FElder, I would like to go with Adol as<<CRLF>>well.<<CRLF>>
#15102FMe too!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FHmm... Well, you are familiar with the<<CRLF>>route.<<CRLF>>
#15001FBut are you sure? In a way, you may be<<CRLF>>the single most unsuitable person for this<<CRLF>>task.
#00500FI'll be okay. I've had more than enough<<CRLF>>time for my wounds to heal.<<CRLF>>
#00109FFrieda...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15005FHmph. Well, I know better than to argue<<CRLF>>with you. Nothing I say is going to<<CRLF>>change your mind.
#15000FSo go on ahead. They'll need a guide<<CRLF>>anyway.<<CRLF>>
#00500FThank you, Elder!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*cackle* Do you need something?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou put a quest on the board, right?<<CRLF>>We're here about that.<<CRLF>>
#00500FCould you tell us what it is you need?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*cackle* Of course. I can rest easy if you're<<CRLF>>the ones taking care of this.<<CRLF>>
What I need you to do is to bring me the<<CRLF>>ingredients to brew up a special elixir.<<CRLF>>
Specifically...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Oh, I'm not allowed to say, am I? I almost<<CRLF>>forgot.<<CRLF>>
#00201FIt's not something dangerous, is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FI don't think we should accept a request<<CRLF>>which may end up directly or indirectly<<CRLF>>harming people.
#00300FConsidering you are asking us to do this<<CRLF>>for you, I feel you do have a duty to<<CRLF>>explain.
That's a completely reasonable view.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But I'm not the one who wants this elixir made.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And I have a duty to protect my client's<<CRLF>>privacy.<<CRLF>>
But I can't force you to accept, either, so if<<CRLF>>you're not interested...<<CRLF>>
#00111FUm, well, actually...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI can promise you on his behalf that it's<<CRLF>>not gonna be used for anything dangerous.<<CRLF>>
#00505FAs can I.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FIn fact, I have a good idea what this<<CRLF>>elixir is, and if I'm right, there's no need to<<CRLF>>worry at all.
#00300FSo client confidentiality is the only reason<<CRLF>>you cannot say, then? The issue is not<<CRLF>>one of...public safety?
#00204FWell, if Duren and Frieda say so, I think<<CRLF>>we can trust him.<<CRLF>>
#00405FWe'll just assume it's something deeply<<CRLF>>personal, and leave it at that.<<CRLF>>
#00100F...Yeah, that sounds about right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*cackle* Well, I'll leave it up to you whether<<CRLF>>you want to undertake this request or not.<<CRLF>>
The ingredients I'll need are as follows.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
A Yupel Flower, a Libra Flower, a Raparo Fruit,<<CRLF>>an Arieda Fruit...<<CRLF>>
Then I'll need a Poisonous Organ and some Frog<<CRLF>>Extract... Oh, and some Acidic Liquid and a<<CRLF>>Slime Mold as well!
I'll need one each of these eight ingredients.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you are inclined to help, I would be most<<CRLF>>appreciative.<<CRLF>>
Looks like you've brought everything I<<CRLF>>asked for.<<CRLF>>
Thank you very much!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CDelivered all of the ingredients.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401F...I wonder what kind of elixir comes from<<CRLF>>such a bizarre set of ingredients...<<CRLF>>
#00205FI can't stop thinking about it either.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*cackle* Well, I can't tell you myself, but how<<CRLF>>about this?<<CRLF>>
I'll get to work making it right away, and when<<CRLF>>I'm done, you can deliver it to my client<<CRLF>>yourselves.
#00100FOh. That works.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FThat's true. You don't have to worry<<CRLF>>about your client's privacy if the answer<<CRLF>>comes from the client directly.
#00305FThat seems an acceptable compromise<<CRLF>>indeed.<<CRLF>>
#15005F...And that's why you came all this way<<CRLF>>to deliver the elixir to me?<<CRLF>>
#15000F*sigh* I don't know why you're so<<CRLF>>interested...<<CRLF>>
#00401FHey, it's in our nature to be curious!<<CRLF>>So what's it for?<<CRLF>>
#15000FWell, if you must know...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FIt's an Anti-Aging Elixir.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Karna and Calilica
#16SWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15001FIs there a problem with that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FI don't see what's so strange about<<CRLF>>wanting to stay young!<<CRLF>>
#00203FW-well, that's true, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FUm, forgive me for asking, but...how old<<CRLF>>are you?<<CRLF>>
#15006FBeen a while since I've thought about it,<<CRLF>>but probably somewhere around...ninety-<<CRLF>>two?
Karna and Calilica
#18SWHAT?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15005FOh, shush, all your shouting is giving me<<CRLF>>a headache!<<CRLF>>
#00503FHeh. It was worth gathering the ingre-<<CRLF>>dients just to see your reactions.<<CRLF>>
#00111FI think you're enjoying this a little too<<CRLF>>much, Frieda...<<CRLF>>
*cackle* I don't think you were expecting that<<CRLF>>answer, were you?<<CRLF>>
Here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204F*sigh* I feel exhausted.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FYeah. It's like this whole ordeal has taken<<CRLF>>a few years off my life...<<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Secret Synthesis'!
Oh, aren't you...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou look kinda familiar yourself.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAre you Pigeon? The one who put a<<CRLF>>quest on the board?<<CRLF>>
That's me, yes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FSo, could you give us some more details?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, should I start by introducing myself?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My name is Pigeon Peacesymbol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I was born in Gllia to a Gllian father and a<<CRLF>>Garmanic mother. My father's father is...<<CRLF>>
#00111FI, uh, wasn't asking you to describe your<<CRLF>>family tree.<<CRLF>>
#00101FJust tell us what your quest is! We don't<<CRLF>>need all the extra details.<<CRLF>>
O-okay. I need your help searching for Rabbit.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00504F...That's it? I think we're going to need<<CRLF>>a little more to go on than that!<<CRLF>>
S-sorry, I'm not used to this...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Rabbit is the name of my partner. A fellow<<CRLF>>explorer.<<CRLF>>
We got separated while traversing the forest,<<CRLF>>and I'd like you to help me search for her.<<CRLF>>
#00105FWhy couldn't you just say that to begin<<CRLF>>with?<<CRLF>>
#00100F...So, where was she when you lost<<CRLF>>track of her?<<CRLF>>
I can't be entirely certain. I just turned to<<CRLF>>say something to her in the Ashen Forest, and<<CRLF>>she was gone!
But the last time I saw her before that was also<<CRLF>>in the Ashen Forest, so I'm quite certain that's<<CRLF>>where our paths split.
We agreed to meet in this village if we ever<<CRLF>>became separated, so I was hoping she'd be<<CRLF>>waiting here for me...but she's not.
Dammit, if I'd only been paying more attention<<CRLF>>to her, this never would've happened!<<CRLF>>
#00505FI understand your frustration, but blaming<<CRLF>>yourself isn't going to help us find her any<<CRLF>>faster.
#00501FWe need to come up with a plan of<<CRLF>>action and focus on scouting out her<<CRLF>>location.
All right. If we split up and search for her,<<CRLF>>then...<<CRLF>>
Refuse his assistance
Nod in agreement
Wh-what do you...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FYeah, I'm with Adol here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThe Ashen Forest is really dangerous,<<CRLF>>and it's pretty easy to get lost in there,<<CRLF>>too.
#00101FWe need to find your partner, but the<<CRLF>>last thing we want is to end up losing you<<CRLF>>as well.
#00101FI don't think that's such a good idea.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FThe Ashen Forest is really dangerous,<<CRLF>>and it's pretty easy to get lost in there,<<CRLF>>too.
#00101FWe need to find your partner, but the<<CRLF>>last thing we want is to end up losing you<<CRLF>>as well.
B-but, I can't just stand around while she's<<CRLF>>in danger! I have to do something!<<CRLF>>
#00500FWe know you're safe and sound. That'll<<CRLF>>help us concentrate on determining her<<CRLF>>whereabouts.
#00500FSo it really would be best if you stayed<<CRLF>>here.<<CRLF>>
...Okay. If that'll make it easier for you to<<CRLF>>find her, I'll do just as you say.<<CRLF>>
Just, please...do everything you can.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
She's probably wandering the Ashen Forest<<CRLF>>alone and frightened as we speak!<<CRLF>>
Save her! I beg of you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe'll get her, don't worry.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FCome on. Let's head out.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Did you manage to find Rabbit?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FYeah. We found her in a cave in the<<CRLF>>Ashen Forest, but...<<CRLF>>
#00501FWell, she insisted she'd be able to find<<CRLF>>her own way back as long as we gave<<CRLF>>her directions.
#00501FShe should've gotten here ahead of us,<<CRLF>>but...she hasn't, I take it?<<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* I knew this was going to happen...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I probably should've explained this to you<<CRLF>>before, but Rabbit's sense of direction is<<CRLF>>plainly awful.
She gets lost very easily on her own, and she<<CRLF>>can't read a map either. But despite that, she's<<CRLF>>got much too much pride to ask for help.
#00111FOh boy... So basically, we're back to<<CRLF>>square one.<<CRLF>>
#00101FWonder where she'll end up this time...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm... Well, her sense of direction is terrible,<<CRLF>>but her intuition can be surprisingly good.<<CRLF>>
She probably won't be wandering aimlessly for<<CRLF>>long, but will instead seek shelter somewhere.<<CRLF>>Like that cave you found her in.
...I can't say for sure, though.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FStill, as her partner, you have a better<<CRLF>>grasp on her habits than we do. We'll try<<CRLF>>to concentrate on possible safe spots.
#00101FLike a camp, maybe?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FI'll say one thing. Searching camps and<<CRLF>>caves sure beats wandering the forest<<CRLF>>hoping to get a lucky break.
#00111F*sigh* Oh well. Suppose we'll have to<<CRLF>>see this through to the end!<<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's get going.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you so much for your help, everyone.<<CRLF>>I don't know what I would've done without you.<<CRLF>>
Come on, Rabbit. You thank them as well!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Well, I suppose I am somewhat thankful for<<CRLF>>your efforts.<<CRLF>>
But you're completely useless, Pigeon!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I can't believe you'd leave searching for me to<<CRLF>>some strangers, and just stand around here<<CRLF>>twiddling your thumbs!
...I hope you're ready for your punishment.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Which will it be? Punishment A, or<<CRLF>>Punishment B?<<CRLF>>
I don't think I want either of them...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What's that, you want them both? Well, aren't<<CRLF>>you a brave soul! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
*cough* On that note, I really do appreciate your<<CRLF>>help.<<CRLF>>
Here's your reward.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThanks!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FTry and get along, now, you two.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505F(Not that that seems very likely...)<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#3CCompleted the quest 'Rabbit Hunting'!
Did you see my quest on the board?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FIndeed we did. What is it you'd like us<<CRLF>>to do?<<CRLF>>
It's something of a ritual.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It's not an especially urgent request, so if<<CRLF>>you're busy, it can wait...but if you'd be<<CRLF>>interested in helping, I'd be very grateful.
#00105FGuess we'll let Adol decide. What do<<CRLF>>you think, Adol?<<CRLF>>
Ah, do you have the time to help me with my<<CRLF>>request now?<<CRLF>>
Accept
Refuse
Really? That's quite understandable.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, if you're ever able to find the time,<<CRLF>>please do let me know.<<CRLF>>
Thank you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Firstly, you'll require this.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FIs this some kind of cursed artifact?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Indeed. It's a foreign charm known as a<<CRLF>>'magatama' that was once owned by a nameless<<CRLF>>knight who lost his life in the Ashen Forest.
Hundreds of years after his death, his<<CRLF>>resentment remains encased within it.<<CRLF>>
I'd like you to purify it and set him free.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FPurifying a cursed artifact, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo what exactly do we have to do?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Firstly, you'll need to allow the magatama's<<CRLF>>owner to take physical form in the world.<<CRLF>>
The lost soul of the knight who bore it still<<CRLF>>roams the Ashen Forest.<<CRLF>>
To allow him to regain his body, you'll need to<<CRLF>>make his soul possess the armor he wore when he<<CRLF>>was alive.
#00500FMake his soul possess his armor? How<<CRLF>>are we supposed to do something like that?<<CRLF>>
Firstly, you'll need to equip the magatama.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you're wearing it on your person, the soul of<<CRLF>>the knight will begin to pursue you.<<CRLF>>
Then you need to lead his soul to the armor,<<CRLF>>which is located somewhere in the Ashen Forest.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd if we do that, it'll possess the armor<<CRLF>>and take form, huh?<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo what do we do after that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
After that...well, you'll need to defeat him in<<CRLF>>battle.<<CRLF>>
As a knight, a last duel is what he craves most.<<CRLF>>Defeat him in such a duel, and he should be able<<CRLF>>to rest in peace.
#00505FAll right. That seems clear, if not a bit<<CRLF>>unconventional.<<CRLF>>
#00105FKinda worried about the duel, though.<<CRLF>>Who knows how strong this guy's gonna<<CRLF>>be?
#00100FBut we accepted the quest, so we gotta<<CRLF>>do what we gotta do. Soon as we're ready,<<CRLF>>let's go find that lost soul!
I see you were able to defeat the knight.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Did you bring the magatama with you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah. Here you go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FI thought we'd see some change in it<<CRLF>>after we defeated him, seeing as you<<CRLF>>said we were purifying it...
#00101FBut nothing happened. Is that normal?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
It is. Besting the knight in a duel was just<<CRLF>>one of the preparations needed to purify the<<CRLF>>charm.
I can handle the rest right now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...There!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe blood-colored markings disappeared from the magatama.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FOh, my...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The purification is complete.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Please, take this with you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWow, it's like new now!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou sure we can have this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Of course. Giving it to you was the reason<<CRLF>>I asked you to complete this quest in the<<CRLF>>first place.
I hope it proves useful to you in some way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FThank you very much, Sydow.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Take this with you, too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Gruda's gone way too far.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder what the others who fled from this<<CRLF>>village are doing now...<<CRLF>>
We here in Danan are well versed in history,<<CRLF>>and devote ourselves to observing its course.<<CRLF>>

But I'm not going to give up. One day, I'm going<<CRLF>>to be a powerful magician just like Sydow and<<CRLF>>Elder Vanjo.
'A magician's greatest goal should not be<<CRLF>>magical ability, but generosity of spirit.'<<CRLF>>

The power of the Masked Division is a mere<<CRLF>>imitation of true strength.<<CRLF>>
When one hones his skills, he also hones his<<CRLF>>spirit. And raw power, without the spirit to<<CRLF>>accompany it, is a fragile thing.
I can't believe anyone would want to call<<CRLF>>himself a Darkling in this day and age. I've<<CRLF>>never heard of anything so ludicrous!
Surely they can't be unaware of the implications<<CRLF>>of what they're doing...<<CRLF>>

This is the start of the final, decisive<<CRLF>>battle, upon which everything hinges.<<CRLF>>Give it your best.
You can do it. If you think positively, positive<<CRLF>>results are sure to follow.<<CRLF>>
It's just a copy, but Gruda's still some sort of<<CRLF>>mad genius to be able to make a mask that can<<CRLF>>draw out a person's latent strength.

Gruda really is a fool, taking on the name of<<CRLF>>the Darklings for himself and repeating exactly<<CRLF>>the same mistakes our ancestors made.

I want one I want one I want one!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
People used to say Gruda was a 'prodigy'...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...What's a prodigy?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
My mom and dad had to go a long way away to<<CRLF>>work.<<CRLF>>
Heheh. Isn't that neat?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
When you've defeated Gruda, you'll have to<<CRLF>>come back here and have dinner with all of us.<<CRLF>>
Let that promise of delicious food guide your<<CRLF>>hand and lead you to victory!<<CRLF>>
Gruda was adorable when he was a kid. He knew<<CRLF>>right from wrong just fine, and everyone loved<<CRLF>>him.
So how did he end up like that? No matter how<<CRLF>>much time passes, I just can't stop wondering<<CRLF>>what snapped within him...
I hear you're going to Elduke.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
The Ashen Forest may be full of dangers, but<<CRLF>>the area around Elduke in particular is crawling<<CRLF>>with monsters.
We wouldn't normally think of going near there,<<CRLF>>but if you really must, at least be certain you<<CRLF>>take every possible precaution.

Make yourselves at home here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
With all you youngsters around, I feel more<<CRLF>>energetic than ever! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
#15000FAh, you're back. What's the situation<<CRLF>>now?<<CRLF>>
#4CThe party described everything that had transpired.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FSo all that remains is for you to go to the<<CRLF>>Temple of the Sun...<<CRLF>>
#15000FDo you really have time to be talking to<<CRLF>>me, then? It seems like you've got more<<CRLF>>important matters to attend to!
#15000FMay fortune smile upon you in the final<<CRLF>>confrontation.<<CRLF>>

#15000FAh, you're back. What's the situation<<CRLF>>now?<<CRLF>>
#4CThe party described everything that had transpired.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FSo you need this 'Mask of the Moon' to<<CRLF>>enter the Temple of the Sun?<<CRLF>>
#15000FI must admit, I was unaware of the other<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel's connection with Gruda. Makes<<CRLF>>sense now that I think about it.
#15000FRegardless, you know what has to be<<CRLF>>done. Now all that remains is to do it.<<CRLF>>
#15000FDon't doubt yourself. Just do what you<<CRLF>>must. Let's end this ordeal once and for all.<<CRLF>>

#15000FDon't doubt yourself. Just do what you<<CRLF>>must. Let's end this ordeal once and for all.<<CRLF>>
#15000FOn the other side of the Ashen Forest<<CRLF>>lies the former capital of the Kingdom of<<CRLF>>Celceta, Elduke.
#15000FIn the center of it sits the 'Temple of the<<CRLF>>Sun,' where Lord Eldeel once resided.<<CRLF>>
#15000FThe journey there won't be an easy one,<<CRLF>>but I know you can do it.<<CRLF>>
#15000FTake care, all of you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15000FThe journey from Danan to Elduke won't be<<CRLF>>an easy one, but I know you can do it.<<CRLF>>
#15000FTake care, all of you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heeheehee, it's time for your punishment! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*whistle* No matter where you do it, shopping<<CRLF>>is always so much fun! <<|F481|>><<CRLF>>
Please do what you can to find my partner.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You're her only hope!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm sorry my partner is causing you so much<<CRLF>>trouble, but please don't give up the pursuit.<<CRLF>>
I don't want to endure...her punishment...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I wonder if anyone will respond to my request...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hahaha... I've never met anyone more carefree<<CRLF>>than Rabbit.<<CRLF>>
We've been through a lot together, and it sure<<CRLF>>is a blessing to have her around.<<CRLF>>
#4CVarious quests are displayed on the board.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FWhoa, what is this place?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FIt looks an awful lot like Lord Eldeel's<<CRLF>>room.<<CRLF>>
#00409FBut there seems to be an even bigger<<CRLF>>collection of books here!<<CRLF>>
#00500FHee. Surprised? We call this building<<CRLF>>the 'Black Archives.'<<CRLF>>
#00309FThe Black Archives?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FYeah. This place is like a collection of all<<CRLF>>of Danan's history and knowledge.<<CRLF>>
#00409FDo you gather information about the<<CRLF>>outside world here as well?<<CRLF>>
#00506FWe do. I'll leave it to the elder to explain<<CRLF>>in more detail, however.<<CRLF>>
#00506FThe Black Archives and its contents<<CRLF>>are closely linked to our purpose in this<<CRLF>>village.
#00401FYou know...this has been bothering me<<CRLF>>since we got here...<<CRLF>>
#00401FI have to know. How did you get from<<CRLF>>here to Casnan?<<CRLF>>
#00209FNow that you mention it...you must have<<CRLF>>crossed the Sanctuary of Storms, right?<<CRLF>>
#00109FO-oh, that? Uhh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FHe used the 'seams.'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FW-wait a minute, Frieda, we can't just...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Seams?
I see.
#00401FI want to know more too!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FI demand an explanation as payment for<<CRLF>>your despicable acts of deceit, Duren!<<CRLF>>
#00412F...That's all the explanation you needed,<<CRLF>>Adol?<<CRLF>>
#00305FThat is quite rare, coming from someone<<CRLF>>who is generally so inquisitive.<<CRLF>>
#00203FYeah, normally he'd be bombarding<<CRLF>>Frieda with questions right now.<<CRLF>>
#00401F...So, what are these 'seams'?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FWith a giant mechanism like the one in the<<CRLF>>Sanctuary of Storms, there are bound to be<<CRLF>>a few 'gaps in the field,' so to speak.
#00101FWe call them seams. In the Sanctuary of<<CRLF>>Storms, they're places where the lightning<<CRLF>>strikes happen with less frequency.
#00101FI've got them memorized, and traveled in<<CRLF>>and out of the Primeval Lands by exploiting<<CRLF>>them.
#00105FWe use the same basic principle to avoid<<CRLF>>losing our memories when we leave the<<CRLF>>area around Highland.
#00300F...I do understand the concept, but is<<CRLF>>such a thing really possible? Particularly<<CRLF>>considering how powerful Eldeel is...
#00500FTo an extent, yes. But there's a little<<CRLF>>more to it as well.<<CRLF>>
#00409F...Magic, I'm guessing?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FMagic? That's the power you wield,<<CRLF>>Calilica, isn't it?<<CRLF>>
#00401FKind of. I use weapons and items that<<CRLF>>were charged with magic, but I can't use<<CRLF>>magic by itself.
#00101FTo use magic, you have to be able to<<CRLF>>control its energy on your own.<<CRLF>>
#00101FSome of the know-how for doing that has<<CRLF>>been passed down here in Danan.<<CRLF>>
#00500FThe methods that are passed down here<<CRLF>>are the same as those used in the ancient<<CRLF>>Kingdom of Celceta.
#00409FI-I see...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00506F...Although Duren doesn't use it very often.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FWell, I'm not very good with it...and I<<CRLF>>don't really wanna rely on the same <<CRLF>>power he did, either.
#00112FHold on, why are we even talking about<<CRLF>>this?!<<CRLF>>
#00512FHeehee. You're always so much fun to<<CRLF>>rile up!<<CRLF>>
#15103FHahaha. He really is! And he's so stupid,<<CRLF>>he falls for it every time!<<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F(The same power 'he' did? Who is 'he'?)<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWait, this house is...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, if it isn't little Duren.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FI think I'm a bit too old to be called<<CRLF>>'little' anymore...<<CRLF>>
#00209FWho's this?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Is this your mother?
Is this your girlfriend?
#00111F...My mother?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Oh, come now, Duren! Is the idea really<<CRLF>>so horrific?<<CRLF>>
Heh. I'm afraid your guess is incorrect,<<CRLF>>however.<<CRLF>>
I'm actually Frieda's mother.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FGeez! Where'd you get that idea?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Heh. No need to be embarrassed, now!<<CRLF>>Really, you should be so lucky. <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
Still, I suppose you must think me quite young<<CRLF>>if I look to be girlfriend material for a<<CRLF>>strapping lad like Duren. So thank you.
But I'm actually Frieda's mother.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI see.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FNow that you mention it, I can kind of<<CRLF>>see the resemblance.<<CRLF>>
#00209FYou and Duren certainly seem to get<<CRLF>>on well.<<CRLF>>
Well, Duren and Frieda have been friends since<<CRLF>>they were practically in diapers.<<CRLF>>
They've never managed to move past that, though.<<CRLF>>You'd think they would've gone beyond friends a<<CRLF>>long time ago...
You're still so young, Frieda! How long are you<<CRLF>>going to keep dwelling on the pas--<<CRLF>>
#00511FM-MOTHER!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00104F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wh-what? What's wrong?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F(I wonder what that was all about.)<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404F(I don't know, but suddenly it's gotten<<CRLF>>pretty awkward in here...)<<CRLF>>
N-never mind that. Do feel free to make<<CRLF>>yourselves at home.<<CRLF>>
With all you youngsters around, I feel more<<CRLF>>energetic than ever! <<|8A87|>><<CRLF>>
#00203FHello! Is anyone home?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209F...Doesn't look like it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FHmm, it seems as if no one has lived here<<CRLF>>for quite a while.<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, this house hasn't been used for a<<CRLF>>long time.<<CRLF>>
Whose house is it?
No one lives here?
#00500FIt belonged to someone Duren and I knew<<CRLF>>many years ago.<<CRLF>>
#00105FAs you can see, it's empty now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FNot anymore, no.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FWhose house was it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FIt belonged to someone Frieda and I knew<<CRLF>>many years ago.<<CRLF>>
#00409F...Hmm?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp5211m.JSON_TEXT 21 >>
#15102F#16SFrieda! I've got a message from<<CRLF>>Duren!<<CRLF>>
#15102F#16SHe... Gruda showed up in Casnan!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FSo, he finally resurfaced, did he?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Camilla
We always knew this day would come.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What about the other two? Are they with him?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00509FMother...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15104FNo, those two brothers aren't with him,<<CRLF>>as far as I can tell.<<CRLF>>
Camilla
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FMother, I'm going to report this to the<<CRLF>>elder.<<CRLF>>
Camilla
Are you sure you're okay, Frieda?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FI'm fine. We won't let Gruda get away<<CRLF>>with what he's done.<<CRLF>>
Camilla
...I'm not talking about Gruda.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00504F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FHe can't be forgiven for taking the Black<<CRLF>>Key out of the village.<<CRLF>>
#00501FEven if he doesn't show his face this<<CRLF>>time, I'm sure he'll be judged for his<<CRLF>>mistakes one day.
#00500FUntil then, all I can do is keep fulfilling<<CRLF>>my duty.<<CRLF>>
#15104FFrieda...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp5303.JSON_TEXT 1 >>
#4CDefeated Compragov and its minions!
<< mp6101.JSON_TEXT 119 >>
#00109FWell, we're out, but...where are we?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIt appears to be a graveyard. And a<<CRLF>>well-kept one, at that.<<CRLF>>
#00209FNot quite what I was expecting!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FSo...we're in the Primeval Lands now,<<CRLF>>right?<<CRLF>>
#00300FLook over there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FIs that...Comodo's great tree?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FSeems to be, yeah.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd if that's over there, then I think we<<CRLF>>can safely say we made it. These are<<CRLF>>the Primeval Lands for sure. Right, Adol?
Right!
Could be a different tree.
#00111FI dunno, though. I feel kinda let down.<<CRLF>>After all this, I thought our arrival here<<CRLF>>would be a little more dramatic.
#00111FLike, we'd all emerge into a stunning<<CRLF>>new world and shout uncontrollably<<CRLF>>with glee or something.
#00210FAAAH!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FNo, it's okay, Karna. The moment's<<CRLF>>passed. No sense forcing it.<<CRLF>>
#00111FNo, I think we'd have noticed another tree<<CRLF>>like that! Come on, Adol. We made it! We<<CRLF>>really made it!
#00100FWe've arrived in a strange new land!<<CRLF>>We should be shouting with glee, or<<CRLF>>moved to tears or...something!
#00210FAAAH!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FClose, but I said 'moved,' Karna. Not<<CRLF>>terrified.<<CRLF>>
#00210FWh-what is this?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat's what?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Something wrong with that grave?
Did you see a ghost?
#00204FY-yeah. Take a closer look.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FDo I look like the kind of girl who'd be<<CRLF>>scared of ghosts?!<<CRLF>>
#00204FJust look at the gravestone!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FThe gravestone?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol and the others examined the front of the gravestone.<<CRLF>>An inscription was carved into its smooth, clean surface:<<CRLF>>
#4C'Here lies Adol Christin'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
All Present
#18S#2MWhaaaaaaaaaaaat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't remember dying!
There must be some kind of mistake.
#00105FNow that's something you don't hear<<CRLF>>every day!<<CRLF>>
#00101FBut unless there's someone else around<<CRLF>>here who happens to have the exact same<<CRLF>>name as you...
#00111FI'd say that's pretty clear, yeah.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...Still, the fact that there exists a grave-<<CRLF>>yard here at all indicates that this side<<CRLF>>of the river is definitely inhabited.
#00300FAnd by all appearances, its inhabitants<<CRLF>>must live quite nearby.<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, these flowers are still fresh, and<<CRLF>>the gravestone itself looks brand new.<<CRLF>>
#00201F...Not to add to the questions we already<<CRLF>>have, but this has been bugging me since<<CRLF>>we found the ruins entrance at Selray.
#00201FI wasn't sure before, but I definitely am<<CRLF>>now. There were no signs of anyone<<CRLF>>going through those ruins in a long time.
That doesn't make sense...
How do you know?
#00204FI know. But I'm completely confident that<<CRLF>>it's true.<<CRLF>>
#00205FWhen we hunt, we often have to follow<<CRLF>>tracks of beasts. And even when there<<CRLF>>are no tracks, there are always signs.
#00201FBut there were no tracks near the<<CRLF>>entrance or exit of the ruins. And no<<CRLF>>signs of any disturbance within them.
#00101FBut here's a grave with Adol's name<<CRLF>>on it, so that proves he did come<<CRLF>>through here, right?
#00101FIf this wasn't his point of entry, then how<<CRLF>>did he get across the river?<<CRLF>>
#00305FI cannot imagine any other route.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FIt seems we are left with more questions<<CRLF>>than answers.<<CRLF>>
#00209FLook at that!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FIsn't that the same kind of bird we saw<<CRLF>>in Selray?<<CRLF>>
#00201FI don't think it's a bird. It looks like one,<<CRLF>>but it's not flapping its wings.<<CRLF>>
#00111FWell, if it's not a bird, then what is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FIt came from deeper in the Primeval<<CRLF>>Lands, but beyond that, I have no idea.<<CRLF>>
#00210F...Are you okay, Adol?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat is it this time?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol explained that he heard a voice in his head, and described<<CRLF>>what it said to him.<<CRLF>>
#00111F...What? That doesn't make any sense!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FYou weren't kidding, Ozma. I've got<<CRLF>>nothing but questions swimming<<CRLF>>around in my head right about now.
I know, isn't it exciting?!
Come on, let's get going!
#00111FFor you, I'm sure! If it weren't, I'd think<<CRLF>>you were some kind of imposter.<<CRLF>>
#00111FOkay, okay! Sure must be nice to be<<CRLF>>so young and spunky...<<CRLF>>
#00203FWe won't find any of the answers we<<CRLF>>need by standing around here.<<CRLF>>
#00305FI agree. We should continue up the hill<<CRLF>>and try to find the people who tend this<<CRLF>>graveyard.
#00100F'Here lies Adol Christin'...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYep, this is the one.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Let's get digging!
I feel a little guilty doing this...
#00100FNever thought I'd go grave-robbing at all,<<CRLF>>much less with the grave's occupant at<<CRLF>>my side.
#00103FCome on, boys, let's get to work!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205F...'Boys'?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FWell, it is a little iffy, I guess.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FGrave-robbing isn't exactly an activity I'd<<CRLF>>normally condone, much less do.<<CRLF>>
#00200FI know how you feel, but I'm confident<<CRLF>>this is the right course of action. Come<<CRLF>>on, let's just get it over with!
#00305FI feel the same. Remember, no one is<<CRLF>>actually buried here. We are not dese-<<CRLF>>crating anyone's final resting place.
#4CAfter digging for a while, a stone coffin was unearthed.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CHesitantly, the lid was slid back to reveal...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209F...Huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...Empty.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FIt's not the wrong grave...is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FNo, this is Adol's. And they did say they<<CRLF>>buried his belongings here...<<CRLF>>
#00300FWait, I think I see something in the<<CRLF>>corner.<<CRLF>>
#4COzma produced a small scrap of paper from the coffin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...Looks like it came from a notebook.<<CRLF>>There's something written on it, too:<<CRLF>>
#00101F'Received the mask from...'<<CRLF>>That's definitely your handwriting, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00209FThe mask...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah, that brings a lot of things to mind.<<CRLF>>But let's think this through for a minute.<<CRLF>>
#00100FFirstly, why are Adol's belongings not<<CRLF>>here when the villagers said they'd be,<<CRLF>>and even apologized for burying them?
They lied.
Someone stole my stuff.
#00111FThat doesn't seem too likely to me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FI agree. The residents of Highland are<<CRLF>>clearly very intelligent. They would not<<CRLF>>present us with an easily exposed lie.
#00300FIf they intended deception, they could<<CRLF>>say that no belongings were found, and<<CRLF>>I doubt we would have questioned it.
#00101FOr just not mention Adol's belongings<<CRLF>>at all. I don't think we would've asked.<<CRLF>>I mean, I wouldn't have thought of it!
#00100FThe most likely possibility seems to be<<CRLF>>that someone else did a little grave-<<CRLF>>robbing before we got here.
#00300FThat seems the most likely scenario to<<CRLF>>me as well.<<CRLF>>
#00300FIf we assume what the villagers said is<<CRLF>>true, Adol's belongings should be buried<<CRLF>>here.
#00300FIf they intended deception, they could<<CRLF>>say that no belongings were found, and<<CRLF>>I doubt we would have questioned it.
#00305FThe most likely possibility here seems to be<<CRLF>>that someone looted your final resting place,<<CRLF>>perhaps considering it a victimless crime.
#00209FSo someone else dug up this grave<<CRLF>>before us?<<CRLF>>
#00201FWhatever was in here must've been<<CRLF>>seriously important to them if they<<CRLF>>were willing to go that far just to get it.
#00100FYeah.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FBut at least we found something!<<CRLF>>'Received the mask from...'<<CRLF>>Not much to go on, but it's a start.
#00105FThough hearing the word 'mask' doesn't<<CRLF>>bode too well for us, given what we went<<CRLF>>through in Comodo...
#00204F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FIt's too early to tell if Remnos is<<CRLF>>connected to this.<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, we've got far too little information<<CRLF>>right now.<<CRLF>>
#00209FStill, it says he received it from someone.<<CRLF>>Who would that be, I wonder?<<CRLF>>
#00305FWhoever it is, it seems reasonable to<<CRLF>>conclude that Adol's disappearance<<CRLF>>occurred shortly after this meeting.
#00300FPerhaps the mask in question is directly<<CRLF>>tied to this incident, and by extension, to<<CRLF>>Adol's memory loss as well.
#00300FI think it would be safest to operate under<<CRLF>>this assumption at the moment, to remain<<CRLF>>on alert while we continue to investigate.
#00105FAll right, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI think it's about time we go meet the<<CRLF>>person living in that tower now...<<CRLF>>
#4CThe gravestone reads:<<CRLF>>'Here lies Adol Christin'<<CRLF>>
<< mp6102.JSON_TEXT 19 >>
#00208FIs that...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00308FAmazing.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00108FA...town? This deep in the Great Forest?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FAnd not just that, but...look at it! It looks<<CRLF>>like a way more technologically advanced<<CRLF>>place than even Casnan!
#00309FWhat is that structure over there? The<<CRLF>>one surrounded by thunderclouds?<<CRLF>>
#00101FSeems like some kinda tower...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Could that be...?
A tower?
#00101FYeah, I think it's safe to assume that's<<CRLF>>the one you marked in your notebook.<<CRLF>>
#00101FI didn't expect we'd find it this quickly.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FYou forgot already? That old notebook<<CRLF>>of yours had a tower marked in it,<<CRLF>>remember?
#00100FWe're on the other side of the river<<CRLF>>now, so that's gotta be the place!<<CRLF>>
#00200FIt looks almost...magical. Like something<<CRLF>>out of a fairytale or an old legend.<<CRLF>>
#00200FI'm sure Remnos would be overjoyed if<<CRLF>>he could see it.<<CRLF>>
I'm sure he would.
Maybe he already has.
#00203FHeheh. I'll have to bring him here<<CRLF>>sometime!<<CRLF>>
#00203FHeheh. Somehow, I doubt that!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI'd say it's high time we go in for a closer<<CRLF>>look. Shall we?<<CRLF>>

#00101FYeah. I guess we're getting near the<<CRLF>>Sanctuary of Storms they were talking<<CRLF>>about in town.
#00100FLet's get a closer look. We'll figure out<<CRLF>>how to make it through in one piece once<<CRLF>>we get there!

#00209FThe rain's really starting to pick up...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe should probably set up a tent here<<CRLF>>and rest, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00209FA tent?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FWow, this is starting to feel really<<CRLF>>exciting now, like we're hiding out in the<<CRLF>>wilderness!
#00305FWe can use this area as a base of<<CRLF>>operations during our time here, then?<<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah, though we need to be back in<<CRLF>>Highland before dawn, so we can't spend<<CRLF>>the night here or anything.
#00100FWe should be able to rest for a little<<CRLF>>while, though, at least.<<CRLF>>
#00203FSounds good to me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CIt was a quiet night. Only the sound of the falling rain and constant<<CRLF>>thunderclaps could be heard echoing through the darkness.<<CRLF>>
#4CThen, with a flash of lightning, a memory sealed deep within<<CRLF>>Adol's mind was released!<<CRLF>>
#00109FAdol? Adol! You okay? You were out like<<CRLF>>a light, man!<<CRLF>>
#00100FCome on, we've gotta get moving. We're<<CRLF>>running out of time.<<CRLF>>
#4CMemory fragments in the surrounding area are\nnow visible on the map.
#00211FI-I thought I was done for... I told you<<CRLF>>it was dangerous to go out there!<<CRLF>>
#00305F*sigh*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FI'm sorry. That probably wasn't one of<<CRLF>>my best ideas.<<CRLF>>
#00300F...Is something the matter?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FSomeone's there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#00182V#16SRight...there!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00386V#16SEEEK!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402F#2MW-watch where you're throwing those<<CRLF>>things! You could put someone's eye out!<<CRLF>>
#00300F#0MIt's you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOh boy, it's the kid from the mayor's<<CRLF>>place.<<CRLF>>
#0M#00460VHmph!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MGrouping all children together with a demeaning<<CRLF>>word like 'kid' is the sort of thing adults do<<CRLF>>when they want to sound smarter than they are.
#0M...It's not an attractive quality, you know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FThe hell's your problem?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FT-try and get along, you guys...<<CRLF>>So, Calilica...<<CRLF>>
#00200FHow long have you been following us?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FI saw you leaving the mansion.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FGrown adults, sneaking out through a<<CRLF>>window... I could hardly believe my eyes!<<CRLF>>
#00300FI suppose you plan to escort us back to<<CRLF>>Highland, then?<<CRLF>>
#00205FY-yeah, I guess we've been caught red-<<CRLF>>handed. Nothing we can do now but go<<CRLF>>quietly!
#00411FThat won't be necessary.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FRather, I'll be coming with you to see<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FI'm an apprentice Apostle, after all. I'm<<CRLF>>not some child who needs protecting.<<CRLF>>
#00400FPlus, I can use my mace to activate the<<CRLF>>lightning conductors on the plains and stop<<CRLF>>the lightning from hitting us.
#00103FWell, I have to admit, that definitely <<CRLF>>sounds handy...<<CRLF>>
#00305FThere is a problem with this course of<<CRLF>>action, however.<<CRLF>>
#00305FIf anyone notices that a child has gone<<CRLF>>missing during the night, along with us,<<CRLF>>it will spark much worry and suspicion.
#00111FY-yeah, that's a good point...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FHey, why don't you come back to town<<CRLF>>with us? We'll make sure no harm<<CRLF>>comes to you along the way.
#00411FOhoho! I scoff at your suggestion!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FIf you think you can talk sweetly and<<CRLF>>get me to submit, you're sadly mistaken!<<CRLF>>
#00400FYou wouldn't want me telling Grandfather<<CRLF>>about this little excursion of yours, now,<<CRLF>>would you?
#00411FBecause that's exactly what's going to<<CRLF>>happen unless you take me with you.<<CRLF>>The choice is yours!
#00111F...Is she trying to blackmail us?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FSure seems that way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305F...But if the mayor discovered you were<<CRLF>>with us, would that not disqualify you as<<CRLF>>an apprentice Apostle?
#00412F*gulp* Y-you're a lot more perceptive<<CRLF>>than I gave you credit for.<<CRLF>>
#00305FWhy are you so determined to accompany<<CRLF>>us?<<CRLF>>
#00300FI assume it is not simply for curiosity's<<CRLF>>sake, nor are you playing a game with us...<<CRLF>>
#00402F#16SO-of course not! I would<<CRLF>>never do something like this<<CRLF>>without a very good reason!
#00404F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404F...Leeza is hiding something about Eldeel.<<CRLF>>I know she is.<<CRLF>>
#00109FHow can you be so sure?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FWe've been together for most of our<<CRLF>>lives. Believe me, I can tell.<<CRLF>>
#00401FWhenever she keeps a secret, it's<<CRLF>>because she's trying to shoulder the<<CRLF>>burden without bothering anyone.
#00402FIt's just the kind of person she is, and I<<CRLF>>hate seeing her suffer like this. I want to<<CRLF>>help her, even if it's just a little bit.
#00209FHave you tried talking to the people of<<CRLF>>Highland?<<CRLF>>
#00404FYeah, but everyone else seems content to<<CRLF>>leave things the way they are. Even Grand-<<CRLF>>father won't do anything to help.
#00404FYou're the only ones who seemed to care<<CRLF>>enough to actually do something about it.<<CRLF>>I figured...maybe I could count on you...
#00404F*sniffle* *sniffle*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00410F#00467V#18SWaaaaah!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FD-don't cry!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FSo you suspected something may be<<CRLF>>amiss at the tower, and decided to take<<CRLF>>matters into your own hands?
#00111FMan, you are one precocious kid. I get<<CRLF>>where you're coming from, but...<<CRLF>>
#00410F*sniffle*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FIs there something wrong with a child<<CRLF>>being precocious?<<CRLF>>
#00401FAdults are always dismissing what <<CRLF>>children say, telling them that they're<<CRLF>>ignorant in the ways of the world...
#00401FBut as soon as a child starts trying to learn<<CRLF>>those ways, it's always adults who put<<CRLF>>them down and say they're not ready!
#00402F#16SAs long as I keep listening to<<CRLF>>what adults tell me to do, I'll<<CRLF>>never become one myself!
#00111F*sigh* All right, all right...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWhat do you think, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Lead us to the tower! Now!
This isn't a game.
#00404FWha...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FWh-what's gotten into you, Adol?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...You're a terrible actor, you know that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYou're trying to make it seem like you<<CRLF>>forced her to guide us, huh?<<CRLF>>
#00305FSo if someone were to discover this<<CRLF>>expedition, you would take all the blame<<CRLF>>upon yourself. How very like you...
#00404FB-but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FAdol is correct. This is not a game.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FBut it is clear that your decision was<<CRLF>>well-reasoned, considered from multiple<<CRLF>>perspectives and executed with discretion.
#00300FIn short, you have acted with maturity over<<CRLF>>impulse, and taken a calculated risk.<<CRLF>>I believe this is what Adol was saying.
#00409FAre you saying...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FHeheh. Way to go, Calilica!<<CRLF>>Welcome to the team.<<CRLF>>
#00403FThank you, everyone!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FIf only you were this well-behaved and<<CRLF>>honest with your feelings from the start,<<CRLF>>you'd be a cute kid.
#00105FSometimes it's important for children to<<CRLF>>act like children, you know? And rely on<<CRLF>>adults to support them.
#00110F#16SOw! What was that for?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FYou said it was important for children to<<CRLF>>act like children, so...that's what I'm doing!<<CRLF>>
#00411FAnd if you attempt to belittle me again,<<CRLF>>just remember...<<CRLF>>
#00403FI BITE.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112F#16SOw! Ow! Stop that! That really hurts!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00306FPff...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203F#16SHAHAHAHA!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401F...I promise to fall back if things get too<<CRLF>>dangerous, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00401FSo please take me to the tower with you!<<CRLF>>Please?<<CRLF>>
Okay. You win.
It's good to have you with us.
#00403F#16SThank you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403F#16SThank you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWell, then, the Sanctuary of Storms<<CRLF>>awaits. You ready?<<CRLF>>

Whew... I don't think the Romuns will follow us<<CRLF>>this far.<<CRLF>>
Probably not.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmph. What's with that uncertain response?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Is there some kind of problem?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, of course there's a problem!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
As if it weren't bad enough we got into trouble<<CRLF>>with the Romuns in the Underground Ruins, we've<<CRLF>>now gotten on their bad side in Highland, too!
We're basically fugitives now!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Do you... Do you regret it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Regret it? Well...yeah!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Nothing good comes from opposing the Romuns<<CRLF>>these days.<<CRLF>>
But I'll admit, I did want to see the Primeval<<CRLF>>Lands for myself.<<CRLF>>
So I'm certainly not blaming you or anything!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
O-okay...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
(For someone who's not blaming me, he sure<<CRLF>>does lay it on pretty thick...)<<CRLF>>
Um, well...thank you, but I was...kind of<<CRLF>>asking if you regretted it...like, on a more<<CRLF>>fundamental level.
Whether you regretted partnering up with me...<<CRLF>>I guess...<<CRLF>>
Rabbit...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wh-what?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I-I just wasn't expecting to hear that kind of<<CRLF>>talk coming from you, that's all!<<CRLF>>
Do I regret partnering up with you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Of course I do!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16SWhat the hell?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Uh, what I'm trying to say is, despite all<<CRLF>>we've been through on this expedition, I'm<<CRLF>>happy with how things turned out in the end.
So I guess...there are more good points than<<CRLF>>bad points?<<CRLF>>
I mean, when I'm with you, I never have time<<CRLF>>to even THINK about being bored!<<CRLF>>
Otherwise I would've dissolved our partnership<<CRLF>>long ago.<<CRLF>>
...Pretty rare to see you speechless.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There's no one around here but us, you know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If you want, I'd be happy to let you cry on--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Think of that last potion as a sign of my<<CRLF>>great mercy.<<CRLF>>
Because if you ever get carried away like that<<CRLF>>again, I AM going to kill you.<<CRLF>>
#1WO-owowow...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And you keep going on about partners and<<CRLF>>partnerships...<<CRLF>>
But we're not partners! You're my servant,<<CRLF>>and I'm your master!<<CRLF>>
And don't you forget it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Err... Rabbit?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That's Lady Rabbit to you, maggot!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

N-no, I'm trying to be serious h--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

It's nothing to worry about.
I had a dream about Eldeel.
#00100FYour memories are our biggest source of<<CRLF>>information at this point.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo make sure you let us know if you<<CRLF>>remember anything interesting, okay?<<CRLF>>
#00300FI had an inkling it may have been Eldeel<<CRLF>>who attacked you in this area.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThough it does beg the question, why did<<CRLF>>he not finish you off?<<CRLF>>
#00100FMaybe it was the same kinda situation as<<CRLF>>when we met him in the tower.<<CRLF>>
#00100FDoesn't seem like his other personality<<CRLF>>has fully awoken just yet, so he probably<<CRLF>>snapped out of it or something.
#00404FYeah, but how long is he going to be able<<CRLF>>to fight turning into that...other person for<<CRLF>>good? That's what I'm worried about.

#00111FOh, it's you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FYou boor! How dare you address the<<CRLF>>great Commander Leo in such a<<CRLF>>dismissive manner!
#10000FI will accept only 'Commander Leo' or<<CRLF>>'Sir Leo' from the likes of you!<<CRLF>>
#00500FAdol, the area ahead of us is filled with<<CRLF>>poisonous gases.<<CRLF>>
#00500FIf you charge in unprepared, it won't be<<CRLF>>long before the poison kills you.<<CRLF>>
#15100FHow are these guys still alive? It's<<CRLF>>actually kinda impressive!<<CRLF>>
#00100FThe gases come from holes in the ground<<CRLF>>scattered all over the Ashen Forest.<<CRLF>>
#00100FThe best thing to do here is...well, leave<<CRLF>>it to Frieda to guide us through safely,<<CRLF>>I guess!
#00510FOh, you're going to make me do all the<<CRLF>>work? Heehee, I don't work for free, you<<CRLF>>know!
#00100F...You hear that? Try to go into this part<<CRLF>>of the forest unprepared and you're liable<<CRLF>>to wind up dead.
#00100FYou want to catch Gruda, right? Then the<<CRLF>>best way to do it is gonna be to follow<<CRLF>>us.
#10005FHmph. Coming second to you would stain<<CRLF>>my honor as a soldier!<<CRLF>>
#10001FWe... We will find a way!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Like what?
We should work together.
#10005FI-I'll think of something!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FCommander, I don't think your pride is<<CRLF>>going to help us here.<<CRLF>>
#10505FHaven't we come to the brink of death<<CRLF>>enough already?<<CRLF>>
#10604FSometimes cooperation isn't such a bad<<CRLF>>thing, you know.<<CRLF>>
#10505FAnd as long as we do our part too, all of<<CRLF>>us are equal. There's no shame in joining<<CRLF>>forces!
#10005F#00931VHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001F...Very well, men. If that is your<<CRLF>>recommendation, then let it not be<<CRLF>>said Commander Leo never listens.
#10005FI value the proposals of my trusted<<CRLF>>subordinates.<<CRLF>>
#10601F(He's just out of ideas, isn't he?)<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10501F(Of course he is. But this is the best<<CRLF>>we're gonna get from him, so shhh!)<<CRLF>>
#10001F...Did you say something?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sancho and Panza
#16SNothing at all, sir!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FAll right, then, Adol...Commander Leo...<<CRLF>>Now that everything's settled, how about<<CRLF>>a handshake in honor of the occasion?
#10005F...Hmph. Such common familiarity does<<CRLF>>not befit a soldier.<<CRLF>>
#00109FOh boy. I'm gonna regret getting us into<<CRLF>>this, aren't I?<<CRLF>>
#10005FH-hmph! Don't get cocky just because<<CRLF>>you're the tiniest bit ahead of us!<<CRLF>>
#10001FI'll leave everything to you for now,<<CRLF>>but mark my words, I'll be the last one<<CRLF>>laughing!

#00111F...Um, excuse me?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
EEK!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Y-you're...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wh-what do you want?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Come back to Danan with us.
Say nothing.
A-are you ignoring me? How rude!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Can't you see I'm in trouble?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FTrouble, eh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FSo what you're trying to say is, 'Please<<CRLF>>escort me back to Danan,' right?<<CRLF>>
Wh-Why would I ask you to do that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Why would I need to be escorted by the likes<<CRLF>>of you?!<<CRLF>>
...But, if you really insist, I suppose I'll<<CRLF>>accompany you. To help you save face.<<CRLF>>
Come on, then! Let's get a move on!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp6165.JSON_TEXT 1 >>
#4CAdol's base STR increased by 1.
<< mp6191.JSON_TEXT 27 >>
#00500FAll right. We've finally made it to the<<CRLF>>ancient battlefield.<<CRLF>>
Ancient battlefield?
Seems really lonely...
#00501FIt's officially called the Colonia Battlefield,<<CRLF>>though it's the only battlefield around...<<CRLF>>and the last fight took place ages ago.
#00501FIt's the spot where Lord Eldeel and King<<CRLF>>Lefance had their final confrontation.<<CRLF>>
#00501FIt's always been a desolate place. All<<CRLF>>my life, at least, and probably for<<CRLF>>centuries before.
#00100FThis is where Lord Eldeel and King<<CRLF>>Lefance had their final battle some...eight<<CRLF>>hundred or so years ago, right?
#00209FKing Lefance was...human, wasn't he?<<CRLF>>How can a battle with a human being<<CRLF>>possibly cause this much devastation?!
#00401FI think he was commanding Sol during<<CRLF>>the battle, just like Leeza back in Danan.<<CRLF>>
#00200FOh. Well, that would explain it!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FHe used just about every piece of techno-<<CRLF>>logy available to him in his attempts to<<CRLF>>pacify Lord Eldeel. Sol included.
#00505FI'm sure it started out as a plan B, but<<CRLF>>when fighting a god, you're not likely<<CRLF>>to push too many options off the table.
#00300FThe Galbalans were created using the<<CRLF>>forbidden arts of your village, correct?<<CRLF>>
#00300FDoes that mean King Lefance himself was<<CRLF>>from Danan?<<CRLF>>
#00501FHe wasn't, no.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FHe was one of those guided to this land<<CRLF>>by Lord Eldeel, much like our ancestors.<<CRLF>>
#00505FBut unlike the others, he was a good man<<CRLF>>who tried his best to prevent them from<<CRLF>>turning against the gods.
#00505F...One of the few righteous men who<<CRLF>>stood in opposition to the...Darklings.<<CRLF>>
#00209FEldeel's the one who brought those<<CRLF>>Darklings back with him, right? I wonder<<CRLF>>why...
#00412FI've always felt he could be forgiving to a<<CRLF>>fault at times, but...I mean, he is a god...<<CRLF>>
#00206FYeah, that sounds like it's one of his<<CRLF>>good points. One of the things that<<CRLF>>makes him so special.
#00500FI completely agree.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FI wonder at what point a good king like<<CRLF>>that would find himself left with no choice<<CRLF>>but to rely on forbidden technology...
#00505FWe'll probably never know for sure.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FBut seeing as our ancestors were lending<<CRLF>>him the aid of those forbidden arts, it<<CRLF>>must have been a dire moment in history.
#00101FHmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FCome on, Adol. We should get moving.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp6192.JSON_TEXT 93 >>
#00209FI thought it seemed awfully cold...<<CRLF>>Is this snow?<<CRLF>>
#00500FIndeed. This is the sacred Mt. Vesuvio.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FIt's said that before taking up the throne,<<CRLF>>King Lefance isolated himself here to pre-<<CRLF>>pare himself for the challenges ahead.
#00300F#2MI have never seen nor heard tell of such<<CRLF>>a peculiarly-shaped mountain before.<<CRLF>>
#00409F#2MWhich of the peaks should we be aiming<<CRLF>>for? There seem to be two of them...<<CRLF>>
#00500F#2MTwo very distinct ones, yes. The eastern<<CRLF>>peak is always covered in snow...<<CRLF>>
#00500F#2M...while the western peak is an active<<CRLF>>volcano, always billowing smoke like<<CRLF>>it is now.
#00500F#2MWe can't climb the western peak at the<<CRLF>>moment, but we should be able to reach<<CRLF>>the snowy eastern peak from here.
#00101FThe Grand Roo and the Roda Tree felt<<CRLF>>an energy here similar to the Mask of the<<CRLF>>Moon, so we don't have much choice.
#00501FI'd suggest we not think too much about<<CRLF>>the road ahead and just start climbing.<<CRLF>>
Man's Voice
#0MCome along, now, pick up the pace!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sancho and Panza
#2MLeft, right, left!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SHalt, men!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sancho and Panza
#16SOne, two, three!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SAt ease!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FI'm exhausted, Sancho. Why do we have<<CRLF>>to keep running around like this?<<CRLF>>
#10504FBrrr... And why is it so cold here?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FIf you want to stay warm, keep moving.<<CRLF>>Being cold is your body's way of telling<<CRLF>>you that it's not moving fast enough!
Sancho and Panza
#16SPlease let us rest!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FHmph. If it isn't Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FHave you come to get in our way again?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FYou know...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FI can totally see you getting in our way,<<CRLF>>but I can't remember a single instance<<CRLF>>where we've ever gotten in yours.
#00111FWhat are you doing here, anyway?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FAren't you supposed to be tailing Gruda?<<CRLF>>'Cause trust me, you're way off the mark<<CRLF>>if you think he's near this mountain.
#10603FHa! We're not telling! It's our secret, and<<CRLF>>we'll take it to the grave with us if we<<CRLF>>have to!
#10600FRight, Commander?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FNo. I'll tell you if you really want to<<CRLF>>know.<<CRLF>>
#10509FWh-what? That's not like you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FThey helped us out in the Ashen Forest.<<CRLF>>And I despise being indebted to people.<<CRLF>>
#10604FBut we worked so hard to get that<<CRLF>>information!<<CRLF>>
#10002FSilence! Stinginess is not befitting of a<<CRLF>>Romun soldier!<<CRLF>>
#10005FNow listen, and listen well!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FThere's currently a large group of Masked<<CRLF>>Division soldiers mobilized on this moun-<<CRLF>>tain.
#00109FR-really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FAnd yet Gruda is inside the Temple of<<CRLF>>the Sun.<<CRLF>>
#10001F...Their place is with their commanding<<CRLF>>officer, so I couldn't help but wonder why<<CRLF>>they'd come here instead.
#10005FMy instincts tell me they're looking for<<CRLF>>something important on this mountain.<<CRLF>>
#00509FThat's not good. Could they be looking<<CRLF>>for the Mask of the Moon as well?<<CRLF>>
#00305FThat seems the most likely possibility.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FEldeel should certainly know of its<<CRLF>>existence.<<CRLF>>
#00404FI guess we need to pick up the pace,<<CRLF>>then.<<CRLF>>
#00109FStill, I'm surprised you three managed to<<CRLF>>uncover that kind of intelligence. That's<<CRLF>>some pretty good work!
#10500FWell, when you spend most of your days<<CRLF>>running around, you do overhear a lot of<<CRLF>>things.
#10600FYep. All you're doing is hiding and listen-<<CRLF>>ing, after all.<<CRLF>>
#10005FS-silence!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001F...Before we go on ahead, I have one final<<CRLF>>question. Young lady, would you happen<<CRLF>>to be related to a man named Remnos?
#00209FYou know Remnos?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FHmph. Much as I don't trust him, he is<<CRLF>>still technically a fellow Romun commander.<<CRLF>>And he seems quite capable in the role.
#10001FSo you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005F...Th-that is to say...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FIf you...if you want another chance to<<CRLF>>talk to him, you should go on ahead.<<CRLF>>
#10001FAnd you should hurry.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FWhat...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FRight. That's enough rest, men! Sancho,<<CRLF>>Panza! We're leaving!<<CRLF>>
#10604FWhaaat?! But we only just got here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505FGive it up, Panza. You know he's not<<CRLF>>going to listen.<<CRLF>>
#10604F#0971V#16SNoooo...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002F#16SOnward MARCH!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00210FW-wait...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Sancho and Panza
#16SCommander, wait for us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00412FOff they go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FOh dear. No one likes a man who doesn't<<CRLF>>know when to give up, you know. Or<<CRLF>>beast, for that matter.
#00105F...Do these even count as men? They're<<CRLF>>more like...things...<<CRLF>>
#00402FStop messing around, you two! They're<<CRLF>>attacking!<<CRLF>>
#14008FAre you all right, everyone?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FI heard everything from Karna and came<<CRLF>>to help.<<CRLF>>
#00403FLeeza!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FPlease leave this area to me and hurry on<<CRLF>>ahead, Adol!<<CRLF>>
#00508FA-are you sure?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14003FI am. I'll keep them under control here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FI'll stay and fight with you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009F...Calilica?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FSol alone would be at a disadvantage<<CRLF>>against these shadows due to their<<CRLF>>nimble movements.
#00402FSo please, let me back you up!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14003FAs long as that's all right with you, it<<CRLF>>would be a big help.<<CRLF>>
#00403F#00456VOf course it's all right!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FPlease stay safe, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402FOnce I've finished here, I'll be right behind<<CRLF>>you.<<CRLF>>
#00501FTake care, Leeza. Calilica.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FDon't do anything stupid. If it gets too<<CRLF>>dangerous, hop on Sol and get the hell<<CRLF>>out of here, okay?
#00411FObviously! I sure don't want to die here,<<CRLF>>after all.<<CRLF>>
#14000FTake care, everyone!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00403F#16SWooooow...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FThe water here is so clear and beautiful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FIt really is amazing. It looks even clearer<<CRLF>>from up close than it did from the top of<<CRLF>>the hill.
#00100FYeah...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWhat is this place, Frieda?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. These are the Lake Tolmes<<CRLF>>Ruins.<<CRLF>>
#00500FAlthough despite the name, they're still<<CRLF>>actively used.<<CRLF>>
Actively used?
Used for what?
#00505FThat's right. I believe they've been in<<CRLF>>use ever since the Kingdom of Celceta<<CRLF>>was first founded.
#00500FThese ruins serve a very important<<CRLF>>purpose.<<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. I'll explain that a little later.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FFor now, just know that these ruins serve<<CRLF>>a very important function that's essential<<CRLF>>to the whole of the Primeval Lands.
#00500FLet's go inside, shall we?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FFingers crossed that we find some kinda<<CRLF>>clue to the Mask of the Moon's location<<CRLF>>in here!
<< mp6201.JSON_TEXT 159 >>
#00109FHey, check that out. Pretty grand-looking<<CRLF>>building.<<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. We're here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FEveryone, welcome to Elduke, the capital<<CRLF>>of the ancient Kingdom of Celceta.<<CRLF>>
#00409FSo this is the place, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FWe finally made it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIt appears the Masked Division are <<CRLF>>patrolling the area.<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah. If they find us this might get messy, <<CRLF>>so we're gonna have to be extra careful<<CRLF>>we're not spotted.
#00100FWhere's the temple?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FThe Temple of the Sun is at the highest <<CRLF>>point in the city, since that's where the<<CRLF>>god himself resided.
#00309FWhat is the significance of that enormous <<CRLF>>tree?<<CRLF>>
#00500FThat's a Roda Tree. A spirit tree created<<CRLF>>by Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#00500FI believe you've seen smaller ones in<<CRLF>>the areas you've used as camps while<<CRLF>>traveling through the forest.
#00209FWow, I had no idea they grew this<<CRLF>>big... Though it's still not as big as the<<CRLF>>great tree in Comodo.
#00200FWhy are they called spirit trees?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FPeople who have a certain degree of<<CRLF>>magical power can supposedly<<CRLF>>communicate with them spiritually.
#00505FBut this Roda Tree is different. It fell<<CRLF>>asleep when the Kingdom of Celceta<<CRLF>>fell, and has never woken up since.
#00100FAll right, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FLet's go up to the Temple of the Sun <<CRLF>>and see if we can figure anything out!<<CRLF>>
Right!
Stay on guard.
#00111FOh boy, here he goes again. I see that <<CRLF>>smile on your face! The more dangerous<<CRLF>>the situation, the better, huh?
#00500FHeehee. Come on, everyone.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah, we don't want the Masked Division<<CRLF>>finding out we're here...<<CRLF>>
#00109FIsn't that...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FRemnos!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00108FKarna, wait!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FI know how you feel, but we really need<<CRLF>>to be careful right now. We can't afford<<CRLF>>to blow our cover.
#00204FI-I know, I'm sorry...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12021FThe second and third regiments will <<CRLF>>remain here to guard the temple.<<CRLF>>
#12021FThe rest of you, hurry on ahead.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12026FI'll follow after delivering my report to <<CRLF>>Lord Gruda.<<CRLF>>
#12025F...Whew...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FI wonder where he's going...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FAdol, this is the perfect chance to have<<CRLF>>a closer look at the Temple of the Sun.<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, let's go check it out before they <<CRLF>>come back!<<CRLF>>
#00209F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWhat's wrong, Karna?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FI-it's nothing. I just thought I sensed<<CRLF>>something nearby...<<CRLF>>
#00109FSomething? Like a beast?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FI don't know, but I've never sensed <<CRLF>>anything like it before.<<CRLF>>
#00500FHmm... We should probably do a quick <<CRLF>>sweep of the area, just to be safe.<<CRLF>>
#00202FThere! Over there!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FThat creature is what I sensed. I'm sure<<CRLF>>of it.<<CRLF>>
#00509FThat looks like a...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500F...Heehee. I see. Adol, let's follow it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15102F#00983VFrieda!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FNina! What's the situation at the temple?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15103FNow's the best chance we've got. There's<<CRLF>>no one around!<<CRLF>>
#15100FThose Masked Division soldiers all suddenly<<CRLF>>came to their senses, then that Leo guy<<CRLF>>came and took them away.
#00200FSounds like Bami's defeat did more than<<CRLF>>just free Remnos.<<CRLF>>
#00100FAnd Leo actually made himself useful, too!<<CRLF>>Didn't see that coming...<<CRLF>>
#00203FHe's not exactly a model soldier, but it's<<CRLF>>obvious he means well and really wants<<CRLF>>to help wherever he can.
#00100FHeh. And to think, up until recently, we<<CRLF>>couldn't get rid of him fast enough!<<CRLF>>
#00103F#00165VTime's a wastin', Adol. We're almost<<CRLF>>there.<<CRLF>>
#00500FThe Temple of the Sun...<<CRLF>>It's almost surreal that we're actually<<CRLF>>going in there.
Leeza's Voice
#00626VAdol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Man's Voice
I see that everyone is here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FKing Lefance...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14305FThe black-winged one is still inside the<<CRLF>>temple, by all appearances.<<CRLF>>
#14300FCompleting the ritual to activate the<<CRLF>>Akashic Records requires a significant<<CRLF>>amount of time.
#14300FI assume he is presently focused on that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00509FCome to think of it, what ever happened<<CRLF>>to Gruda?<<CRLF>>
#14305FI'm afraid I cannot say.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWe should remain on guard. He is not a<<CRLF>>foe to be underestimated.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo, uh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWe've been so focused on getting inside<<CRLF>>the temple, we haven't really had much<<CRLF>>time to think about this, but...
#00101FHow exactly are we supposed to stop<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel, anyway?<<CRLF>>
#00506FOh, dear! Are you starting to get scared,<<CRLF>>Duren? Afraid we won't be able to finish<<CRLF>>what we started?
#15111FDuren's a scaredy cat, Duren's a scaredy<<CRLF>>cat!<<CRLF>>
#00111FOh, come on... I'm sure that thought's<<CRLF>>crossed your mind too by now!<<CRLF>>
#00300FI agree, it would be unwise to challenge<<CRLF>>him unprepared.<<CRLF>>
#14305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FAs it stands, there is little chance of<<CRLF>>Eldeel returning to his former self.<<CRLF>>
#14012FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300F...There is no need to panic. The key to<<CRLF>>subduing him lies in the Mask of the Moon.<<CRLF>>
#14300FAlthough its effects will be temporary, the<<CRLF>>Mask of the Moon has the ability to seal<<CRLF>>the black-winged one's power.
#14300FEldeel designed it with such function<<CRLF>>himself.<<CRLF>>
#00209FSo how does it work?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14305FYou will have to force the mask onto him.<<CRLF>>It will be no easy task, but...it's the only<<CRLF>>way.
#14305FIf successful, Eldeel will be returned to his<<CRLF>>normal self, albeit only for a short time.<<CRLF>>
#14300FDuring that time, we can retake the Mask<<CRLF>>of the Sun and he won't be able to use<<CRLF>>the Akashic Records for nefarious ends.
#14004FSo we may be able to stop the records<<CRLF>>from being misused, at the very least.<<CRLF>>And that's definitely our primary concern.
#14004FBut when you say Lord Eldeel would only<<CRLF>>return to normal for a short period of<<CRLF>>time...
#00409FLeeza...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FWe must speak with Eldeel once he is<<CRLF>>cognizant again. Then, perhaps, we can<<CRLF>>find another way.
#14300FFor now, it's best if you not overthink<<CRLF>>the situation. Concentrate only on what<<CRLF>>must be done.
#14005FY-yes...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FFirst things first, we have a door to open,<<CRLF>>right?<<CRLF>>
#00500FWe do. But the question is, who should<<CRLF>>do the honors?<<CRLF>>
#00100FHeh, I think we all know the answer to<<CRLF>>that.<<CRLF>>
#00203FYep!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00306FIndeed.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FNo objections here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00510FHeehee. Nor here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15100FWell, if Frieda says so...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14003FI have no objections either.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FAll of this started when you came to<<CRLF>>Celceta, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00301FThis crisis would have occurred sooner or<<CRLF>>later, whether you had visited this land or<<CRLF>>not.
#00500FBut if not for you, I don't think we'd have<<CRLF>>met one another like this, nor would we<<CRLF>>be so close to resolving the matter now.
#00400FAdol's definitely been the glue that's held<<CRLF>>us all together during this journey.<<CRLF>>
#00100FYep, Adol, you're the man. If anyone's<<CRLF>>going to open up this ancient temple,<<CRLF>>it's gotta be you!
#14000FYou were the one Lord Eldeel chose to<<CRLF>>summon to his tower during these try-<<CRLF>>ing times, after all.
#14306FIt would seem you have been chosen by<<CRLF>>destiny to aid this land in its time of need,<<CRLF>>Adol Christin.
#14301FTherefore, I would ask that you don the<<CRLF>>mask now and stand before the temple<<CRLF>>door.
#00109FIt opened!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWhat awaits us inside may be beyond all<<CRLF>>imagining...<<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee, it's finally happening. The time<<CRLF>>has come.<<CRLF>>
#00402FDon't worry, Leeza. We'll bring Lord<<CRLF>>Eldeel home safely.<<CRLF>>
#14001FI know you will.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FLet's go, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#4CIt would be unwise to get any closer.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe Masked Division soldiers continue to patrol this area. It would<<CRLF>>be unwise to get any closer.<<CRLF>>
#4CNow is the perfect time to examine the Temple of the Sun in more<<CRLF>>detail, since no one is patrolling the area.<<CRLF>>
#4CKarna sensed something nearby. It would be best to investigate.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FI will remain here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FPlease make certain you're fully prepared<<CRLF>>for anything.<<CRLF>>
#14000FAre you ready, everyone?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FThen let's hurry to Lord Eldeel!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FThere are more behind us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWha...? Are they following us?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FCould they be attracted by the Mask of<<CRLF>>the Sun?<<CRLF>>
#00101FI dunno, but their numbers sure are<<CRLF>>growing. This isn't gonna be easy...<<CRLF>>
#16SOut of the way! Step aside!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FCommander, wait for us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10504FDon't just leave us behind!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FFOOLS! You need more training!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12023FHaha. I'd say they did pretty well just<<CRLF>>keeping up with us.<<CRLF>>
#00109FLeo...and Remnos? Sancho and<<CRLF>>Panza?<<CRLF>>
#00409FWhat are you doing here?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12026FWe heard everything from the Roda Tree<<CRLF>>and the Grand Roo.<<CRLF>>
#00500FAre you here to help us, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FHmph. Just doing my job of giving a re-<<CRLF>>port on everything that happens to the<<CRLF>>Governor General, as well as to Romn.
#10000FAnd I only trust what I've seen with my<<CRLF>>own eyes.<<CRLF>>
#10600F...Is that the reason we're here?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505FPretty sure I remember the Commander<<CRLF>>yelling something like, 'I'm the only one<<CRLF>>who can save Adol!' before taking off...
#10002FSilence! That's a...a minor detail!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FYou! Adol, don't just stand there!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10000FGet going! We don't have all day!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FWe'll take care of everything here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FI'm guessing Karna's not with you right<<CRLF>>now because she's doing the same<<CRLF>>thing elsewhere, no?
#00100FHaha. Like sister, like brother.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FThank you so much!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00502FAdol, let's leave this in their hands and<<CRLF>>get going.<<CRLF>>
#14301FAdol... What a fine young man.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14115FI couldn't agree more.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14115F...I'm more than fortunate to have been<<CRLF>>able to meet someone like him before<<CRLF>>my final rest.
#14300FYou are determined to go through with<<CRLF>>this, then?<<CRLF>>
#14106F...Mankind has become much stronger than<<CRLF>>it was in the age of the gods.<<CRLF>>
#14100FThe Akashic Records have lost their power,<<CRLF>>and my duty has been fulfilled.<<CRLF>>
#14103FI can now rest in peace.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp6201b.JSON_TEXT 124 >>
#00209FDon't see anyone else here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FWell, this is the place. The Temple of the<<CRLF>>Sun, once the center of the Kingdom of<<CRLF>>Celceta.
#00401FSo this is where Lord Eldeel used to live...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThe building appears to be in better <<CRLF>>condition than its environs.<<CRLF>>
#00109FIt's really frustrating to think that what<<CRLF>>we're trying to protect is right within our<<CRLF>>grasp, but locked behind this door...
So let's open the door!
What should we do?
#00505FWeren't you listening when the elder and<<CRLF>>I were talking, Adol?<<CRLF>>
#00501FWe've tried to open this door more times<<CRLF>>than we can count, but it's just not<<CRLF>>possible.
#00100FWell, we open it, of course!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505F...Duren, weren't you listening when the <<CRLF>>elder and I were talking?<<CRLF>>
#00501FWe've tried to open this door more times<<CRLF>>than we can count, but it's just not<<CRLF>>possible.
#00100FMaybe not, but we still have to try.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAdol, you take that side.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505F#00561V*sigh* Honestly...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FIt's times like these when locked doors<<CRLF>>are meant to just magically open, you<<CRLF>>know?
#00105F#16SHrrrnnnnnnnnnng!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102F#00118V#18SHrrrnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00511FN-no... Could it be?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe door remained firmly shut and sealed.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*huff* *huff*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FIt seems that doors do not have the <<CRLF>>magical properties you attribute to them<<CRLF>>after all.
#00412F...That was hard to watch.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FDammit all...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FWe're so close! If only we could get<<CRLF>>to those Akashic Records, we could<<CRLF>>ruin Gruda's plans completely!
#00409FCome to think of it, whatever happened<<CRLF>>to Lord Eldeel and Leeza?<<CRLF>>
#00200FThey should've gotten here before us, but<<CRLF>>I don't see any sign of them anywhere...<<CRLF>>
#00500FHmm... Nina, will you go look for Leeza?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15114FAww, seriously? That sounds like such <<CRLF>>a pain...<<CRLF>>
#00510F...Please?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15109FF-fine!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15104FYou know I can't refuse your little<<CRLF>>'requests.'<<CRLF>>
#15104F...Honestly...*mumble* *mumble*...it's <<CRLF>>cruel and unusual punishment that I was<<CRLF>>made this way...
#00300FNina...is a fairy created through alchemy,<<CRLF>>you said?<<CRLF>>
#00300FDo you know who created her?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00511F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FOh boy...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...Did I touch upon a sensitive subject?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FNo, it's...quite all right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FNina was created by my ex-fiancee.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00210FWhaaat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FOoooh!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FWas he one of the villagers we saw in<<CRLF>>Danan?<<CRLF>>
#00500FNo, unfortunately not. He left Danan a<<CRLF>>number of years ago.<<CRLF>>
#00409FOh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FA number of years ago? Are you<<CRLF>>saying...?<<CRLF>>
#00500FThat's right. He left at the same time<<CRLF>>as Gruda.<<CRLF>>
#00300F...My apologies. I had no idea.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FDo forgive my indiscretion.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. No, please, there's nothing to<<CRLF>>worry about. Really. It's all in the past<<CRLF>>now.
#00500FHis younger brother left around the same <<CRLF>>time as well.<<CRLF>>
#00505FHe said he was determined to bring his<<CRLF>>older brother back home.<<CRLF>>
#00500FI wonder where they are now...<<CRLF>>Idiots, both of them.<<CRLF>>
#00209FFrieda...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FI'm sorry, that turned into quite a <<CRLF>>tangent!<<CRLF>>
#00505FWe need to decide what our next course<<CRLF>>of action will be. Right, Duren?<<CRLF>>
#00104F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FDuren?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...O-oh, yeah. Sorry.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FOur objectives are to return Eldeel to his<<CRLF>>normal state and prevent Gruda's plans <<CRLF>>from coming to fruition.
#00300FBut without significantly more information,<<CRLF>>we have little chance of succeeding in <<CRLF>>either goal.
#00101FFiguring out how to bring Lord Eldeel <<CRLF>>back is gonna be a hard one.<<CRLF>>
#00111FWe haven't got the slightest idea where<<CRLF>>we should even start looking.<<CRLF>>
#00401FWe may need to do some research, and<<CRLF>>try to find out exactly what happened <<CRLF>>eight hundred years ago.
Man's Voice
#1MI'll spare you the trouble.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10302FYou again?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00302F#0MGadis!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400FHeh. I trust you've all been well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F#0M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F#0MSo you've been lying in ambush for us<<CRLF>>this whole time, huh?<<CRLF>>
#10225FHmph. No, I'm afraid you're not important<<CRLF>>enough to warrant such wasted effort.<<CRLF>>
#10221FWe're meeting someone else here<<CRLF>>altogether.<<CRLF>>
#00109F#0M...What?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00107F#00089V#16SAaaaaaaargh!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00407F#00386V#16SEeeeeek!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00307FUgh... I am...unable...to move...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00507FNo! This is...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10224FAh, it appears our guest has arrived.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10226F#2MYou grace us with your presence, Lord <<CRLF>>Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#00108F#16SWh-what?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402F#16SLord Eldeel?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00508FDamn you, Gruda...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FI hadn't even considered the possibility he<<CRLF>>might be involved with...THIS Lord Eldeel...<<CRLF>>
#00402FThat explains how he knew so much about <<CRLF>>the Sanctuary and the tower...<<CRLF>>
#00304FIndeed, what better source can one <<CRLF>>consult than Lord Eldeel himself?<<CRLF>>
#14121FI see we have some unwanted guests, <<CRLF>>Gruda.<<CRLF>>
#10225F#2MI do apologize, my lord. It appears they<<CRLF>>must have entered while I was busy<<CRLF>>elsewhere.
#14125FNo matter. We have more important <<CRLF>>things to discuss. You brought the item <<CRLF>>I requested, no?
#10220FIt's right here, my lord.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10224FIt honors me to be the one returning it<<CRLF>>to its rightful owner. None are more<<CRLF>>worthy of its possession than yourself.
#10226FPlease accept it as an offering from me<<CRLF>>to you.<<CRLF>>
#00208FThe mask!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14123FAh, the Mask of the Sun! How long has it <<CRLF>>been since I last held it in these hands?<<CRLF>>
#10224FOh!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300FWhoa...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400FIt's beautiful...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14130FOPEN!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00108FHoly crap! It worked!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00508FSo that's why the door wouldn't open. <<CRLF>>The Mask of the Sun was its key...<<CRLF>>
#14135F#00801VHahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14130FThe resting place of the Akashic Records<<CRLF>>has been laid bare before us!<<CRLF>>
#14131FCome, Gruda.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10226FYes, my lord.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Wait!
What are you going to do?
#10226FStay where you are and witness a<<CRLF>>fantastically historic moment.<<CRLF>>
#10220FThe moment in which Lord Eldeel <<CRLF>>becomes a true god!<<CRLF>>
#10220FHah! Must I really state the obvious for <<CRLF>>you?<<CRLF>>
#10220FLord Eldeel is at long last going to <<CRLF>>become a true god.<<CRLF>>
#10226FStay where you are, and consider it an<<CRLF>>honor to witness such a truly historic<<CRLF>>moment.
#00402F#16SLord Eldeel!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00313FThe door is closing!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00102F#16SUgh... Get back here, Gruda! <<CRLF>>Dammit all!<<CRLF>>
#00102FWe...urgh...didn't make it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00504FSo now Lord Eldeel and Gruda are both <<CRLF>>inside...<<CRLF>>
#00501FWe have no choice but to try and find <<CRLF>>some other means of opening the door.<<CRLF>>
#00305FSearching blindly without even knowing if<<CRLF>>an alternative route exists does not seem <<CRLF>>to be the best use of our time.
#00501FRight, but we have to do something. <<CRLF>>Maybe we can start by searching the<<CRLF>>area around the temple?
#00501FAssuming there is another way to open <<CRLF>>the door, this seems as good a place as<<CRLF>>any to look for it.
#00201FWe might find some clues on how to<<CRLF>>bring Eldeel back, too.<<CRLF>>
#00202FThis isn't over yet!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FWell, let's not just stand around, then.<<CRLF>>We've gotta get moving!<<CRLF>>
#00500FLet's go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp6210.JSON_TEXT 606 >>
#00209FWhere are we...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FWe seem to have entered the roots of <<CRLF>>the Roda Tree. I had no idea there was<<CRLF>>a place like this here...
Mysterious Voice
This way. Come along, now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FStop that, Duren! It's creepy! You're<<CRLF>>much too old to be making voices like<<CRLF>>that!
#00412FHonestly, that's the sort of thing a<<CRLF>>ten-year-old would do! Are you going<<CRLF>>through a mid-life crisis?
#00112FN-now just hang on a minute here! <<CRLF>>How come it's always my fault? <<CRLF>>I didn't say a thing!
#00209FI think...it came from inside.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FReally?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411F...I guess we can go take a look...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWhat...is this place?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FIt's full of creatures like the one I<<CRLF>>sensed...<<CRLF>>
#00403FThey're so cuuuute!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FJust as I thought. These are one of the<<CRLF>>many sacred beasts of the forest. They<<CRLF>>are called 'Roos.'
#00309F...Sacred beasts?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FThere are a number of different kinds of<<CRLF>>sacred beasts living in Celceta, all be-<<CRLF>>stowed upon the world by Lord Eldeel.
#00500FThese Roos are one of the more re-<<CRLF>>nowned, though Spardas are rather<<CRLF>>popular as well.
#00309FDo the Spardas live in this area?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FNot here, exactly, but they do live in the<<CRLF>>outskirts of Elduke.<<CRLF>>
#00109FThat's right, Ozma, you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Do you want to go see them?
We have bigger fish to fry.
#00300FI am grateful for your concern, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FBut right now, we have far more urgent<<CRLF>>matters we must attend to.<<CRLF>>
#00300FPerhaps we can see the Spardas after<<CRLF>>we have finished here.<<CRLF>>
#00305FIndeed we do.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FPerhaps we can see the Spardas after<<CRLF>>we have finished here.<<CRLF>>
#00500F...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FSounds like you've encountered the<<CRLF>>Spardas before.<<CRLF>>
#00305FI am most familiar with the Spardas, yes.<<CRLF>>Although this is not the time to discuss it.<<CRLF>>
#00300FMay I ask why these Roos are considered<<CRLF>>sacred beasts?<<CRLF>>
#00500FI'm afraid I don't know very much about<<CRLF>>them myself.<<CRLF>>
#00500FLegend has it that they used to be mon-<<CRLF>>sters who could speak in human tongue,<<CRLF>>even. But that was long ago.
#00504F...I can't imagine that voice we heard<<CRLF>>earlier could have come from a Roo.<<CRLF>>
#00400FIt sounded more like...an old man.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, only one way to find out. Let's go<<CRLF>>farther in and snoop around a little!<<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. That plan is very you, Duren.<<CRLF>>But I certainly can't fault its logic!<<CRLF>>
#00511F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00110FWh-what...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FI-is that a Roo?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FI'm not sure. I've never heard of them <<CRLF>>growing so big before.<<CRLF>>
#00209FCould that voice we heard have been...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mysterious Voice
Yes, that was me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Mysterious Voice
I am the Grand Roo. The oldest of all the Roos<<CRLF>>here.<<CRLF>>
And I am the one who summoned you here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F#16SI-it can talk?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00511FI...can hardly believe it...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, I'm the one you heard, but it was actually<<CRLF>>the Roda Tree that asked me to summon you.<<CRLF>>
I'm merely acting as a go-between, since you<<CRLF>>can't speak with it yourselves.<<CRLF>>
Honestly, it really is quite a bother, and<<CRLF>>I'd much rather be resting right now.<<CRLF>>
But, the Roda Tree simply wouldn't take no for<<CRLF>>an answer...and wouldn't leave me alone until<<CRLF>>I did what it asked, the meddlesome thing!
See, it had been asleep for the past several<<CRLF>>centuries...<<CRLF>>
But it awoke when it felt an evil presence in<<CRLF>>the Temple of the Sun.<<CRLF>>
One very similar to the presence it felt before<<CRLF>>it fell asleep in the first place.<<CRLF>>
...Or so the senile old fool claims.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00508FDoes that mean the Roda Tree knows <<CRLF>>how the Kingdom of Celceta collapsed?<<CRLF>>
Naturally. Much like now, Lord Eldeel was<<CRLF>>a bit touched in the head.<<CRLF>>
The evil presence in the temple at this moment<<CRLF>>is exactly the same as it was then, too. Exactly!<<CRLF>>
...It was King Lefance who managed to bring<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel back to his right mind.<<CRLF>>
And he gained the power to do so through <<CRLF>>another mask. A twin, possessed of the <<CRLF>>power to oppose the Mask of the Sun.
...Or, again, so the senile old fool claims.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F#16SAnother mask?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That's right. The Mask of the Moon.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* ...Let me talk, you old windbag!<<CRLF>>I swear, trees make the worst conversation<<CRLF>>partners...
#00501FThe Mask of the Moon? I had no idea <<CRLF>>such a thing existed...<<CRLF>>
The Masks of the Sun and Moon are two sides<<CRLF>>of the same fruit.<<CRLF>>
With the Mask of the Moon, you would be able<<CRLF>>to enter the Temple of the Sun.<<CRLF>>
#00508FReally?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Or...so the senile old fool claims.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FDo you know where this Mask of the <<CRLF>>Moon is?<<CRLF>>
It's been a long, long time since that mask's<<CRLF>>presence was last felt.<<CRLF>>
#00111F...Oh.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
However, there are two places that seem to be<<CRLF>>exhibiting similar energy patterns now.<<CRLF>>
One of these is Mt. Vesuvio, where the late<<CRLF>>King Lefance went to train and meditate.<<CRLF>>
The other is the ruins on Lake Tolmes, where he<<CRLF>>is said to have first resolved to establish the<<CRLF>>Celcetan Empire.
...Or so says...this damned tree.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00504FBoth Mt. Vesuvio and the Tolmes Ruins<<CRLF>>are on the outskirts of Elduke. They're not<<CRLF>>far from here at all.
#00100FLet's go, Adol. We don't have much time <<CRLF>>left.<<CRLF>>
Wait. There is...*sigh*...apparently one more<<CRLF>>important fact you need to know. And this had<<CRLF>>better be it, you old fossil!
It's the way to counteract Eldeel's madness.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What is it?
Is that even possible?
Neither I nor the Roda Tree know the exact<<CRLF>>method...<<CRLF>>
Neither I nor the Roda Tree know the exact<<CRLF>>method...<<CRLF>>
But King Lefance must know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Memories are often left behind in places to<<CRLF>>which the soul has a strong connection.<<CRLF>>
As you've lost many of your own memories,<<CRLF>>surely you're familiar with this. I believe,<<CRLF>>for you, they've thus far manifested in white.
I'm sure you'll learn more by experiencing the<<CRLF>>memories of King Lefance for yourself, should<<CRLF>>you come across them. And they are out there!
...Or...well, you know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you.
We'll do our best.
The Roda Tree says you're welcome. And I say...<<CRLF>>get out.<<CRLF>>
I wish you well...says the Roda Tree.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What? Hmm... Really, now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...Don't mind me. I'm just catching up with<<CRLF>>this old splinter.<<CRLF>>
Take care on your journey, young ones.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...So says the Roda Tree.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FYou've been a great help.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FWe truly appreciate your assistance.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I need to rest now. The Roda Tree has made <<CRLF>>my already weary bones even wearier with <<CRLF>>its incessant chatter...
Sleep...is calling me...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FI don't think he's going to wake up again <<CRLF>>for a good long while.<<CRLF>>
#00505FIt seems our next two destinations are<<CRLF>>Mt. Vesuvio and the Lake Tolmes Ruins.<<CRLF>>
#00500FBoth are out past the temple grounds'<<CRLF>>east exit, and both are treacherous, <<CRLF>>so we can investigate either one first.
#00500FLet's go, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FAh...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FRemnos, you're okay!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FI see you've regained consciousness.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FI assume Bami's curse has indeed been<<CRLF>>lifted, then.<<CRLF>>
#00403FHahaha. You're a hit with the little Roos,<<CRLF>>it seems!<<CRLF>>
#12020FKarna... Adol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI am in your debt.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Don't worry about it.
How are you feeling?
#0MHaha. To be honest, I'm a little embarrassed<<CRLF>>for all the trouble I've caused.<<CRLF>>
#0MI'm still not completely back to my old self...<<CRLF>>but I'm getting there.<<CRLF>>
#00205FDon't worry me like that again, okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12025FKarna, I...I'm sorry...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12024FI really overdid it this time. I stepped<<CRLF>>outside my comfort zone, and look where <<CRLF>>it got me.
#12024FI believe I really am better suited to <<CRLF>>playing the harp and making crafts<<CRLF>>after all.
#00200FReally? I'm not so sure about that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI kinda hate to admit it, but you were <<CRLF>>pretty impressive as a warrior.<<CRLF>>
#00203FI'm sure Father and everyone else in<<CRLF>>Comodo would've been shocked if they'd<<CRLF>>seen you like that. Heheh...
#12024FDo you...really think so?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIncidentally, what happened to Leo?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12021FAs soon as I woke up, he ran off. He<<CRLF>>said he had a mission to take care of.<<CRLF>>
#12020FHe's done a lot for me too. I need to<<CRLF>>thank him next time I see him.<<CRLF>>
#00100F...Well, Karna, I guess this means your<<CRLF>>journey's at an end, huh?<<CRLF>>
#00200FWell...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FI accomplished my goal, yes, but...it's <<CRLF>>not like Remnos and I can just go back<<CRLF>>to Comodo as if everything's fine now.
#12021FThat's right. If we don't stop Gruda, the<<CRLF>>whole of the continent will be in grave<<CRLF>>danger.
#00501FOh, that reminds me. There's something <<CRLF>>we were hoping to ask you, Remnos...<<CRLF>>
#12021F...Looks like you managed to recover both<<CRLF>>halves of the Mask of the Moon, then.<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, but they lost their power, just like <<CRLF>>you said. We're kinda at a loss now on<<CRLF>>what to do with them.
#00505FThe Grand Roo said that he and the Roda<<CRLF>>Tree could sense the mask in two places...<<CRLF>>
#00501FBut I have to admit, this wasn't quite<<CRLF>>what I was expecting.<<CRLF>>
#12021FWell...there may yet be some recourse. <<CRLF>>I've been researching a few things since<<CRLF>>my arrival in Elduke.
#12021FAnd it seems there's an old laboratory<<CRLF>>around here that was once used for <<CRLF>>researching and repairing artifacts.
#00209FArtifacts?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FIn other words, magic items.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWe've got quite a few of them at this <<CRLF>>point. Like the Dwarf Bracelet and the <<CRLF>>Water Dragon's Scales.
#00400FMy mace is an artifact, too.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FHmm... So assuming the Mask of the <<CRLF>>Moon is an artifact as well, it may be <<CRLF>>possible to restore it at that facility?
#12021FThat was my thought, yes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12025FThe only problem is, I don't know where <<CRLF>>the facility is located.<<CRLF>>
#12020FI suppose the fastest way to find out<<CRLF>>would be to ask the Roda Tree and <<CRLF>>Grand Roo.
#00209FHave you spoken with them?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FUnfortunately. They kept asking me to <<CRLF>>play my harp for them. Constantly.<<CRLF>>Practically every hour of every day.
#12026F*sigh* I've barely had a moment's rest.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FSomehow, I'm not surprised.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, if they already know about you, <<CRLF>>that's at least a little less we need to <<CRLF>>explain.
#00100FWhat do you say we go have a chat <<CRLF>>with the Roda Tree, Adol?<<CRLF>>
#12022FHey, Gramps! Wake up!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Well, if it isn't the harpist. And the rest of<<CRLF>>you have returned as well.<<CRLF>>
...I'm sensing you've also brought the Mask of<<CRLF>>the Moon with you, no?<<CRLF>>
#12020FWe have. And that's actually what we've<<CRLF>>come to discuss.<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol recounted recent events to the Grand Roo.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
An artifact laboratory, you say? There is indeed<<CRLF>>one nearby.<<CRLF>>
However, the battle between Lord Eldeel and<<CRLF>>King Lefance was particularly fierce in that area.<<CRLF>>
There's no way to know if the facility is still<<CRLF>>functional.<<CRLF>>
#00111FMan, I was afraid you were gonna say<<CRLF>>something like that.<<CRLF>>
#12021FLooks like we may need to come up with<<CRLF>>another plan.<<CRLF>>
No, no, I think this is an idea well worth<<CRLF>>exploring.<<CRLF>>
You may be able to find something worthwhile<<CRLF>>there, if nothing else. And...<<CRLF>>
There is an interesting visitor there at this<<CRLF>>moment.<<CRLF>>
...Or so says the Roda Tree.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FAn interesting visitor?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FOh! Could it be Leeza?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00504FCome to think of it, I wonder if Nina was<<CRLF>>able to find her successfully.<<CRLF>>
The laboratory is north of the Colonia<<CRLF>>Battlefield. You should depart immediately.<<CRLF>>
Hmm?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...It seems the Roda Tree has a gift for you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FA gift?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Thank you.
What is this?
Oho, aren't you a well-mannered young man?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Allow me to explain.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
During the final years of the Kingdom of<<CRLF>>Celceta, a variety of experiments were<<CRLF>>conducted.
Among them were experiments that produced<<CRLF>>living weapons, which cannot be defeated<<CRLF>>through conventional means.
And many of those living weapons still lurk<<CRLF>>in the laboratory you're about to enter.<<CRLF>>
#00109FSo you're saying our weapons won't hurt<<CRLF>>them?<<CRLF>>
#00101F...Actually, didn't we run into one of those<<CRLF>>when we were out on the battlefield?<<CRLF>>
#00300FAre you referring to the monster that<<CRLF>>was guarding that door?<<CRLF>>
#00101F...Actually, didn't we run into one of those<<CRLF>>when we were out on the battlefield?<<CRLF>>
#00300FAre you referring to the monster that<<CRLF>>was guarding that door?<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah. Could that have been one of these<<CRLF>>'living weapons'?<<CRLF>>
#00101FSo you're saying our weapons won't hurt<<CRLF>>them?<<CRLF>>
#00501FIf that's the case, how do we defend<<CRLF>>ourselves?<<CRLF>>
The sword Adol was just given is an artifact<<CRLF>>that allows you to deal the finishing blow to<<CRLF>>living weapons.
#00305FI see. So without that, we would be<<CRLF>>unable to enter the laboratory.<<CRLF>>
Think of it as a reward for driving away the<<CRLF>>evil that slithered its way into Elduke.<<CRLF>>
...iiiis what the Roda Tree says.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12023FWell then, I guess I'd better start getting<<CRLF>>ready.<<CRLF>>
#00205FWhere do you think you're going? You're<<CRLF>>not done recovering yet!<<CRLF>>
#12021FB-but, I was hoping to see that laboratory<<CRLF>>for myself...<<CRLF>>
#12020FI may be useful to have along, too. I<<CRLF>>might notice something you would<<CRLF>>otherwise overlook!
#00205FNot happening. You're going to stay here<<CRLF>>and rest, and that's that.<<CRLF>>
#00201FDo as your older sister tells you, just this<<CRLF>>once, okay?<<CRLF>>
#12025F*sigh* Fiiine...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hoho... Take care, young ones.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Incidentally... My back is unbearably itchy at<<CRLF>>the moment, and I would very much appreciate<<CRLF>>it if someone could scratch it for me...
*cough* ...S-says the Roda Tree.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWell, Adol, looks like it's back to the<<CRLF>>ancient battlefield for us. Come on!<<CRLF>>
#2MYou seem unusually supportive of them, Roda.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2M...I suppose you're right. They seem much like<<CRLF>>him when he was young.<<CRLF>>
#2MBut even the presence of his direct descendant<<CRLF>>won't make repairing the mask any easier of<<CRLF>>a task.
#2M...And about this 'interesting visitor' you<<CRLF>>mentioned...<<CRLF>>
#10CWhat's that big fat human doing here? Makes me<<CRLF>>mad just lookin' at 'im!<<CRLF>>

#10C#2rNAME! NAME!#0r<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10COh my, that human really is enormous, isn't<<CRLF>>he?<<CRLF>>
#10CHe's like a bear...or a panda, or something<<CRLF>>like that.<<CRLF>>
#10COh, but I suppose as pandas are black and<<CRLF>>white, they don't make for a very good compar-<<CRLF>>ison. So let's go with the bear.
#10CEither way, he's really huge, isn't he? You<<CRLF>>don't see humans that big very often. Actually,<<CRLF>>we don't see humans here very often, period!
#10CAnyway, moving on. The other day, the Grand<<CRLF>>Roo...<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rTHAT HUMAN IS SUPER BIG.#0r<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10C#2rLOOK AT HIS THICK NECK.<<CRLF>>LIKE BEAR. OR PANDA.#0r<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rBUT PANDA IS BLACK AND<<CRLF>>WHITE AND HE IS MORE<<CRLF>>SEPIA.
#10C#2rBECAUSE THIS IS THE<<CRLF>>MEDIEVAL TIMES SO SEPIA<<CRLF>>TONE! GET IT?
#10C#2rANYWAY. SO I SAYS TO<<CRLF>>MABEL I SAYS...<<CRLF>>
#10CThe sound of this harp really is wonderful.<<CRLF>>It's music to my ears!<<CRLF>>
#10CStill, if you asked me whether I'd prefer to<<CRLF>>listen to this harp or eat a Roda Fruit,<<CRLF>>naturally I'd choose the Roda Fruit every time.
#10CThe harp is difficult to pass on, though. Just<<CRLF>>listening to it makes me feel all energetic and<<CRLF>>bouncy.
#10CIt really does seem to have a strange power to<<CRLF>>it, no? Though the Roda Fruit does too, perhaps<<CRLF>>even more so. So my answer stands!
#10CAnyway, moving on. The other day, the Grand<<CRLF>>Roo...<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rI LOVE THE HARP.<<CRLF>>I GUESS YOU COULD CALL<<CRLF>>ME...A HARPY!#0r
#10C#2rHAHAHA. GET IT?<<CRLF>>KIND OF LIKE LIGATY.#0r<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rTHEY WERE LABELED AS<<CRLF>>SUCCUBI IN FELGHANA<<CRLF>>BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE.#0r
#10C#2rTHERE HAVE BEEN A FEW<<CRLF>>SUCH MISTAKES SO FAR<<CRLF>>BUT MOST WENT UNNOTICED.#0r
#10C#2rHOPEFULLY THERE ARE NOT<<CRLF>>ANY SUCH MISTAKES IN<<CRLF>>CELCETA!
#10CI wonder what's wrong with him? He's been<<CRLF>>lying there for ages now, not moving...just<<CRLF>>groaning every so often.
#10CI wonder if he's actually all right, and he's<<CRLF>>just enjoying everyone giving him attention?<<CRLF>>I could easily see that.
#10CBut if he really is just enjoying the attention,<<CRLF>>that's pretty shameful of him, and he mustn't<<CRLF>>be a very nice person.
#10CHe seems nice, though. So that can't be right!<<CRLF>>Can it? ...No, no, certainly not. Maybe.<<CRLF>>Perhaps.
#10CMoving on... The other day, the Grand<<CRLF>>Roo...<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rDUDE IS OUT COLD.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10C#2rHE IS LIKE TOTALLY<<CRLF>>COMATOSE BRAH.#0r<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rMAYBE HE IS FAKING<<CRLF>>IT FOR ATTENTION WHICH<<CRLF>>WOULD BE MOST UNCOOL.#0r
#10C#2rBUT THAT IS A TOTALLY<<CRLF>>GNARLY ACCUSATION.#0r<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rHE SEEMS WAY TOO<<CRLF>>TUBULAR FOR THAT!<<CRLF>>
#10CHey, listen, listen! The other day, I ate a Roda<<CRLF>>Fruit.<<CRLF>>
#10CAnd it was the bestest Roda Fruit I ever ate! Do<<CRLF>>you want to know why? Of course you want<<CRLF>>to know why, and I want you to know why!
#10CIt was really, really sweet! How sweet? Hmm...<<CRLF>>About as sweet as honey, maybe? Yes, yes,<<CRLF>>honey will do.
#10C...It really was that sweet! Although actually,<<CRLF>>come to think of it, it might have been even<<CRLF>>sweeter than honey.
#10CThe point is, it was sweet! I've never tasted<<CRLF>>anything like it. I probably won't taste<<CRLF>>anything like it ever again, either.
#10CMoving on... The other day, the Grand<<CRLF>>Roo...<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rLISTEN LISTEN.<<CRLF>>YOU LIKE RODA FRUIT?<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rRODA FRUIT IS TASTY.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10C#2rSUPER SWEET! LIKE HONEY!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10C#2rMAYBE EVEN MORE THAN<<CRLF>>HONEY!#0r<<CRLF>>
#10C#2rLIKE PURE SUGAR.<<CRLF>>MADE ME SUPER BOUNCY!#0r<<CRLF>>

That look suits you, young ones. You're<<CRLF>>much prettier now than before.<<CRLF>>

I didn't expect to bump into someone with<<CRLF>>similar interests to me in a place like this.<<CRLF>>
Wahaha! Small world, huh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12029FOh, do you want me to play with you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FI'm sorry, I'm a bit busy at the moment.<<CRLF>>Maybe later.<<CRLF>>
#12020FGazock says he was in Selray for a<<CRLF>>while.<<CRLF>>
#12020FI can't believe he managed to come<<CRLF>>this far into the forest just because he's<<CRLF>>interested in old ruins!
#12020FHe's bound to outlive us all, with that<<CRLF>>kind of energy.<<CRLF>>
#12020FWe haven't been talking for that long,<<CRLF>>but I feel like I'm going to get on really<<CRLF>>well with Gazock here.
#12023FI was starting to get bored, having no<<CRLF>>one to talk to. So he came at a good time.<<CRLF>>
#12020FWould you like to hear me play the harp?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12023FYou've got good taste! I like you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12025FI'd like to come with you, but I suppose<<CRLF>>it's best I do as I'm told and rest.<<CRLF>>
#12020FNot that playing the harp doesn't sap my<<CRLF>>energy too, mind you!<<CRLF>>
#12020FAlthough the Roos and the Roda Tree<<CRLF>>seem to love it, so I don't mind at all.<<CRLF>>
#12025FI'd like to come with you, but I suppose<<CRLF>>it's best I do as I'm told and rest.<<CRLF>>
#12020FTake care of yourselves out there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12029FOh, I don't think I've seen you here before.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12023FNice to meet you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FWell, let's go and see the Grand Roo.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FI'll tell you more once we're there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#12024F...Ugh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00201FJust hold on a little bit longer...<<CRLF>>We'll be done before you know it!<<CRLF>>
#12024F...Ugh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#10000FLooks like you managed to defeat that<<CRLF>>vile Bami.<<CRLF>>
#10005FAs you can see, he's resting at the<<CRLF>>moment.<<CRLF>>
#10005FAll we can do is wait for him to wake up.<<CRLF>>He should be back on his feet in no time.<<CRLF>>
#10500FHe seems to be sleeping peacefully, at<<CRLF>>least.<<CRLF>>
#10600FWonder if it's because of where we are.<<CRLF>>This is a really relaxing place.<<CRLF>>
#10500FYeah...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505F...Although I feel like all the Roos are<<CRLF>>staring at me.<<CRLF>>
#10005FOh, but why are you wasting your time<<CRLF>>here?! You've have more important things<<CRLF>>to take care of, don't you?!

#10002FThere's no time to waste! Go and finish<<CRLF>>off that damned sorceress!<<CRLF>>
#10500FHuh, do you want some fruit or some-<<CRLF>>thing?<<CRLF>>
#10505FSorry, I haven't got any.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10500FWell, I'm glad you managed to remove<<CRLF>>his curse, at least.<<CRLF>>
#10500FWe're not out of the woods until he's<<CRLF>>regained consciousness, but we at<<CRLF>>least know he's gonna be okay.
#10501FHurry up and do something, please!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505F...I can't bear to watch him like this<<CRLF>>much longer.<<CRLF>>
#10600FH-hello... Er, I suppose they can't<<CRLF>>understand what we're saying, can they?<<CRLF>>
#10600F...I wish they could. Then I could ask<<CRLF>>them for some fruit.<<CRLF>>
#10600FIt really is relaxing here.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FI've had enough of snowy mountains for<<CRLF>>a whole lifetime, let me tell you!<<CRLF>>

#10CSo where was I? Oh, yes, today there are a<<CRLF>>large number of Raparo Fruits.<<CRLF>>
#10CBut the taste is a bit lacking, I'm afraid.<<CRLF>>Quantity over quality.<<CRLF>>
#10CBut if you eat all of the fruits in a specific<<CRLF>>order, I think you can make up for that.<<CRLF>>Here's the order, so pay attention!
#10CFirst you should stuff yourself full with<<CRLF>>Arieda Fruits.<<CRLF>>
#10CWhen your mouth is hot they taste sweet,<<CRLF>>right? At least, I think so.<<CRLF>>
#10CAnyway, after that, you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10CProose, I think you need to let him start<<CRLF>>eating already.<<CRLF>>
#10CI don't think his stomach can last much<<CRLF>>longer!<<CRLF>>
#10CBut I'm in the middle of explaining...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10CWell, if you say so, I suppose it wouldn't<<CRLF>>be such a bad idea to let him start. We are<<CRLF>>best friends, after all!

#00209FIt's so quiet in here...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI would suspect no one is around.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FThis area was once used as an audience<<CRLF>>chamber.<<CRLF>>
#14300FThe black-winged one is in the room<<CRLF>>beyond here, where the Akashic<<CRLF>>Records are stored.
#14300FWe must hurry, Adol. Our time grows<<CRLF>>ever shorter.<<CRLF>>
#00102FWhere did these things come from?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FThey're pretty creepy-looking. They're<<CRLF>>like...shadows, or something.<<CRLF>>
#00401FI've never seen monsters like these<<CRLF>>before.<<CRLF>>
#00302FThey are coming for us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FWhew. Good thing there weren't too<<CRLF>>many of them.<<CRLF>>
#00509FI wonder how they managed to get inside<<CRLF>>the temple.<<CRLF>>
Eldeel's Voice
I think it would be more appropriate to say that<<CRLF>>they spawned from within the temple.<<CRLF>>
#00409FLord Eldeel...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FI fear the distorted Akashic Records are<<CRLF>>beginning to exert an effect on the real<<CRLF>>world, and those shadows came about.
#14116FIt's probable that similar phenomena are<<CRLF>>occurring elsewhere in this land as well.<<CRLF>>
#00101FOh boy, that's not good...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FBut if that is the case, then not even this<<CRLF>>temple is safe anymore.<<CRLF>>
#00305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOzma? Something wrong?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FAdol, I will remain here and protect Lord<<CRLF>>Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#00502FAlone? No, I can't let you do that. I'll<<CRLF>>stay with you.<<CRLF>>
#00300FFrieda, you and Duren are the most<<CRLF>>familiar with this area. Your place<<CRLF>>is with Adol now.
#00301FI will take care of Lord Eldeel.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00509FOzma...<<CRLF>>Thank you.<<CRLF>>
#00200F...I don't know this area at all, really. No<<CRLF>>better than Adol himself, at least. So I'll<<CRLF>>stay behind too.
#00409FKarna?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FIf you're on your own and the enemy<<CRLF>>paralyzes you, it's over. Allow me to<<CRLF>>make sure that doesn't happen.
#00206FIn Comodo, we always hunt in groups of<<CRLF>>at least two for that exact reason.<<CRLF>>
#00306FThank you. Your kindness is most<<CRLF>>appreciated.<<CRLF>>
#14115F...Thank you so much, both of you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll see you again later.
Don't let your guard down.
#00301FOf course.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FYou take care too, everyone!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FIndeed. Do not worry about us. We will<<CRLF>>persevere.<<CRLF>>
#00203FWe won't let them get anywhere near<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel!<<CRLF>>
#00101FThank you, Ozma...Karna...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWe'll be back.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FGruda won't do any more harm to<<CRLF>>Celceta on our watch!<<CRLF>>
<< mp6212.JSON_TEXT 222 >>
Depart for Iris
Cancel
You again...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Do you never tire of trying to interfere, red-<<CRLF>>haired swordsman?<<CRLF>>
And as for you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MLoathsome King of Celceta, who has kept me<<CRLF>>sealed away for all these centuries...<<CRLF>>
#0MWhat brings you crawling back after all this<<CRLF>>time?<<CRLF>>
#14305FBlack-winged one, what a curious question<<CRLF>>you ask.<<CRLF>>
#14310FWhy else would I be here than to have<<CRLF>>you return the Mask of the Sun and the<<CRLF>>Akashic Records?
#00109F#2MWait, that huge round thing is the Akashic<<CRLF>>Records?!<<CRLF>>
#00208FI was thinking it'd be a book...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14123FHah! The Akashic Records contain laws<<CRLF>>that construct the world around us, as<<CRLF>>well as all that has been or ever will be.
#14123FAnd the path that every being will take,<<CRLF>>man and god alike...<<CRLF>>
#14125FSuch an unimaginable volume of informa-<<CRLF>>tion could not possibly be stored in a mere<<CRLF>>book!
#14123FAnd yet, despite possessing something so<<CRLF>>powerful, the white-winged one did little<<CRLF>>with it.
#14123F...Truly a fool.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14002FHow dare you! Lord Eldeel, he...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Calm down, Leeza.
What are you trying to do?
#14004FI-I'm sorry, Adol, I just...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FSo what are you planning on doing with<<CRLF>>it?<<CRLF>>
#14123FHah. Must I really state the obvious?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14123FI'll use it to bring natural disasters upon<<CRLF>>the whole Europan continent, the likes of<<CRLF>>which the world has never seen before.
#14125FEarthquakes, floods, firestorms, plagues...<<CRLF>>disasters of such scale that they eradicate<<CRLF>>humanity from the land altogether!
#00508FC-can he really do something like that?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14305FI'm afraid so. The Mask of the Sun allows<<CRLF>>its wearer to alter the Akashic Records.<<CRLF>>
#14305FIf the wearer so desires, the records of<<CRLF>>our world and the people within it can<<CRLF>>be...overwritten. At least partially.
#00109FYou've gotta be kidding...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00302FWhy would you wish to do such a thing?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FHumans are sinful creatures, yes, but we<<CRLF>>cannot accept that such a fate is inevitable<<CRLF>>nor even deserved!
#14125FHmph. You know why I'm doing it?<<CRLF>>Because it's an act befitting a god.<<CRLF>>
#00402FYou're trying to tell us that wiping out<<CRLF>>humanity is something a god's SUPPOSED<<CRLF>>to do?!
#00402FThere's no way that--<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14121FI've wasted enough time talking to you<<CRLF>>feeble creatures.<<CRLF>>
#14120FAt least act like humans in your final<<CRLF>>moments, and kneel before me...<<CRLF>>
#00208FThe mask!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14135FThe time for exposition is over. To mark<<CRLF>>this moment of becoming a true god, I<<CRLF>>shall bury you with my own hands.
#14133FHahaha... Consider yourselves fortunate<<CRLF>>to be permitted such an honor!<<CRLF>>
#00101FUgh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FIt seems we have no choice, Adol. You<<CRLF>>will have to seek an opening while fighting<<CRLF>>him.
#14311F#16SBe on your guard!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FDid...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FDid we...win...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14125F...Very...good...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00509FWha... What...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FLeeza! Look!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FI see it. His hair and his wings...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14306FIt appears we have our chance to<<CRLF>>speak with the true Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#2M#14110FRrngh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2M#14110FAdol... Quickly, hand me the Mask of the<<CRLF>>Moon...<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol gave the Mask of the Moon to Eldeel.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14115FNow...I should be able to remain in this<<CRLF>>persona...for a while.<<CRLF>>
#14116FWhen I created this mask...I had no idea<<CRLF>>it would be used...quite like this...<<CRLF>>
#14118FMaybe I should have...designed it...to look<<CRLF>>a little more...appealing...<<CRLF>>
#14000FPff...haha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00403FWell, the ending was a little anti-climactic,<<CRLF>>but I'm glad everything worked out.<<CRLF>>
#0MI am overjoyed to see that you all made it here<<CRLF>>safely.<<CRLF>>
#0MAnd I'm sorry for worrying you, Leeza...and<<CRLF>>Calilica...<<CRLF>>
#0MAs for you, Adol, I've no doubt...caused you<<CRLF>>no end of trouble.<<CRLF>>
#14116FAnd...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14306FIt has been quite a while, my dear friend.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116F...Eight hundred years, I believe?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FThank you for sealing away the black-<<CRLF>>winged one all those centuries ago.<<CRLF>>
#14116FAlthough I could never have imagined that<<CRLF>>you'd continue to keep it sealed away for<<CRLF>>so long...
#14115FThat wasn't what we agreed on...but at<<CRLF>>this point, I'm just glad to see you safe.<<CRLF>>
#14301FEverything is thanks to Adol and his friends.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FStill, it does not seem we have the luxury<<CRLF>>of time to be reminiscing about the past.<<CRLF>>
#14116FYou're correct. We don't.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FUm, King Lefance...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FWouldn't it be possible for me to seal<<CRLF>>away the other Lord Eldeel, the same<<CRLF>>way you did?
#14004FIf there's anything I can possibly do to<<CRLF>>help...<<CRLF>>
#14300FLeeza...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14115FLeeza, I appreciate the sentiment.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14115FBut it is not my wish to seal him away<<CRLF>>at the expense of someone else's life.<<CRLF>>I never hope to see that happen again.
#14009F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14115FLong ago, I believed that he was a<<CRLF>>completely separate being who had<<CRLF>>manifested within me.
#14115FHowever, as time passed, I came to real-<<CRLF>>ize that he is as much a part of me as the<<CRLF>>one you see before you now.
#00408FWh-what do you mean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14115FI've long believed that keeping harmony<<CRLF>>in the world by carefully meting out know-<<CRLF>>ledge was my duty, and I did so as such..
#14115FBut at some point I began to doubt whe-<<CRLF>>ther giving knowledge to people in this<<CRLF>>manner was the right thing to do.
#14116FThose doubts constantly grew within me,<<CRLF>>eventually coming together and taking form.<<CRLF>>
#14116FAnd that is the black-winged one who<<CRLF>>stood before you earlier.<<CRLF>>
#14012FThat can't be true...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FOn the surface, he may seem to be the<<CRLF>>embodiment of cruelty, simply existing to<<CRLF>>inflict destruction upon the world.
#14116FBut he believes that by overcoming the <<CRLF>>great ordeals placed before them, people<<CRLF>>can develop on their own.
#14309FLooking back upon history, it is true that<<CRLF>>people become stronger through over-<<CRLF>>coming adversity.
#14116FAnd as a result, people learn to think<<CRLF>>and walk for themselves, without the<<CRLF>>aid of gods.
#14116FIn a sense, the black-winged one was<<CRLF>>born just as much out of love for<<CRLF>>humanity as I.
#14309FI had no idea...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Man's Voice
So it seems even God is imperfect.<<CRLF>>How...disappointing.<<CRLF>>
#00102F#16S#0MGruda!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F#0MHow is Lord Eldeel imperfect for showing<<CRLF>>concern?!<<CRLF>>
#10225FYou hadn't noticed?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10225FThe black-winged one didn't use the<<CRLF>>power of the Mask of the Sun in your<<CRLF>>battle at all.
#14009F#0M...Now that you mention it...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F#0MHe...didn't?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116F#0M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10226FSuch a careless error. But now I have the<<CRLF>>chance to see my true desires realized...<<CRLF>>
#10224FI wish to see how humanity reacts when<<CRLF>>faced with cruel, cold despair, greater even<<CRLF>>than the ordeals of a god...
#00402F#0MWh-what are you saying?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10221FThat's why I supported the black-winged<<CRLF>>one and devised this new generation of<<CRLF>>Darklings who mourn this world.
#10225FAnd yet this 'god' here has proven quite<<CRLF>>useless to that end.<<CRLF>>
#00501F#0MGruda... You...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10224FA perfect ordeal can only be executed by<<CRLF>>one who bears perfect malice... In other<<CRLF>>words, humanity itself.
#10222FIf it is the duty of a god to challenge<<CRLF>>humanity, then truly, it is a duty most<<CRLF>>befitting a human!
#00508F#16S#0MThe Mask of the Sun?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14309F#0MWhen did he acquire that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116F#16S#0MNo! How?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FHe's...gone...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00302FWhere did he go...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14311FI dare not even say it, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FI fear that's exactly what he did. He has<<CRLF>>entered Iris.<<CRLF>>
#00408FIris?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FThe place where the contents of the<<CRLF>>Akashic Records are stored.<<CRLF>>
#14116FThey take the form of spiritual light, and<<CRLF>>occupy another world where they can<<CRLF>>typically be neither seen nor touched.
#14116FAnd that World of Records is known by<<CRLF>>the name 'Iris.'<<CRLF>>
#00509FAnd that's where you suspect Gruda has<<CRLF>>gone?<<CRLF>>
#14116FIt's the only logical conclusion.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FThe Mask of the Sun was originally made<<CRLF>>to allow its wearer to enter Iris and change<<CRLF>>the records stored within.
#14116FI fear that Gruda is going to bring about<<CRLF>>disaster in the real world by manipulating<<CRLF>>the records directly.
#00111F*sigh* He just keeps sinking lower and<<CRLF>>lower.<<CRLF>>
#00505FHe's even more brazen than the other<<CRLF>>Lord Eldeel...<<CRLF>>
#00300FWe cannot allow him to have his way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FBut what are we supposed to do?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14305FEight hundred years ago, the black-winged<<CRLF>>one entered Iris much like Gruda has now.<<CRLF>>I followed him and sealed him away.
#14300FWith time, however, the seal weakened<<CRLF>>and he managed to break free...<<CRLF>>
#00100FI see... So that means we can follow him<<CRLF>>inside, then?<<CRLF>>
#14115FIndeed. I will secure a route using the<<CRLF>>Mask of the Moon.<<CRLF>>
#14115FThat should grant you access.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FThanks. Glad to have someone like you<<CRLF>>on our side.<<CRLF>>
#14305FI will join Adol and the others within the<<CRLF>>World of Records. I should be able to guide<<CRLF>>you through its depths, at the very least.
#00500FThank you, King Lefance.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FLord Eldeel, I...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FI'm afraid Sol-Galba's mass may be too<<CRLF>>much for me to transfer inside.<<CRLF>>
#14115FCould I ask you to remain here and<<CRLF>>support me?<<CRLF>>
#14001FY-yes, of course.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FWe have to hurry, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FThe black-winged one is not sealed away<<CRLF>>forever. If sufficient time passes, he will<<CRLF>>begin to re-emerge.
Okay. Let's get going, then.
I'll face him as many times as it takes!
#14301FRemarkable. There's not an ounce of<<CRLF>>hesitation on your face.<<CRLF>>
#14305FYou almost make me understand the black-<<CRLF>>winged one's perspective. You represent<<CRLF>>the capability and ingenuity of humanity.
#14305FMuch as I wish to compliment your bravery,<<CRLF>>we must avoid unnecessary confrontation.<<CRLF>>
#14305FThere are others around us to consider,<<CRLF>>after all.<<CRLF>>
#14116FI will open the gate to Iris.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FThank you, my friend.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FIs that it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FThis is the gate, yes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FAdol... Best of luck to you in there.<<CRLF>>Be very careful, and...Godspeed.<<CRLF>>
#14000FThank goodness you're all safe!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14115FI'm delighted to see all of you again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14310FWhat's happening, Eldeel?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14310FAdol and his friends were victorious, but<<CRLF>>something is...not right...<<CRLF>>
#00309FIs this...another earthquake?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FThey're happening in our world, too?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FSeriously, I know I said this already,<<CRLF>>but what the hell's going on?<<CRLF>>
#14116FThat's what I need to discuss with you.<<CRLF>>Please, come this way.<<CRLF>>
#14309F...Something abnormal is occurring in the<<CRLF>>Akashic Records?<<CRLF>>
#14116FIndeed. I suspect Gruda's actions in Iris<<CRLF>>created inconsistencies and contradictions<<CRLF>>within them.
#14116FI fear that the earthquakes and other odd<<CRLF>>occurrences are a result of the records...<<CRLF>>essentially collapsing in on themselves.
#00402FWhat's going to happen if it continues?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14305FEight hundred years ago, this region<<CRLF>>became the Great Forest as a result<<CRLF>>of the black-winged one's actions.
#14009FIt wasn't a forest before?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FIt was not. And considering what Gruda's<<CRLF>>done this time, the consequences are<<CRLF>>likely to be far greater...
#14116FAt worst, the whole of the western part<<CRLF>>of the continent may sink into the ocean,<<CRLF>>with Celceta at its center.
#00109FNo way...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14305F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FUnder normal circumstances, I would be<<CRLF>>able to go inside Iris and repair the records.<<CRLF>>
#14116FBut the errors now are too extensive. I<<CRLF>>would have no means of repairing them<<CRLF>>before significant damage is done.
#00404FN-no...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00502FLord Eldeel, is there no other way to<<CRLF>>stop this from happening?<<CRLF>>
#14116F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116F...There is one.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FAdol, I would like to ask you to destroy<<CRLF>>the Mask of the Sun.<<CRLF>>
#14310F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14012FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FThe Mask of the Sun is effectively a<<CRLF>>master key to the Akashic Records.<<CRLF>>
#14116FIf it is destroyed, then by design, the<<CRLF>>Akashic Records can no longer exert any<<CRLF>>influence on this world whatsoever.
#00101FBut...wait, is it really okay to do that?<<CRLF>>I mean, don't we...need them?!<<CRLF>>
#14115FI will not allow this continent to suffer<<CRLF>>the same fate as my homeland.<<CRLF>>
#14004FLord Eldeel...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FThere is, however, one complication in<<CRLF>>this plan.<<CRLF>>
#14116FThe Mask of the Sun cannot be easily<<CRLF>>destroyed, even by myself.<<CRLF>>
#00209FOh. So, how do we...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FPlease consider this a personal<<CRLF>>request, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#14116FI would like you to hurry to the peak of<<CRLF>>Mt. Vesuvio, and cast the Mask of the<<CRLF>>Sun into the volcano's crater.
#00309FThe mountain with two peaks?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FYes. Only the energy that flows through<<CRLF>>the earth itself is capable of destroying<<CRLF>>such a powerful artifact.
#00501FBut...isn't the route to the volcano crater<<CRLF>>inaccessible?<<CRLF>>
#14001FNot anymore. When I surveyed that area<<CRLF>>earlier, the earthquakes had caused the<<CRLF>>fissures in the mountain path to fill.
#14001FHowever, the earthquakes have made it<<CRLF>>much more active than it was before, so<<CRLF>>it's still a dangerous request.
#14116FI know this is a tremendously difficult<<CRLF>>task to entrust you with, Adol...but I beg<<CRLF>>of you. Please.
#14009FLord Eldeel...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'll give it a try.
Why are you asking me?
#14115FThank you, Adol. From the bottom of my<<CRLF>>heart.<<CRLF>>
#14116FIn all the time I've been watching you,<<CRLF>>you have performed more admirably<<CRLF>>than I could ever have imagined.
#14116FAs selfish as this may be, I suppose you<<CRLF>>could say I want to see for myself how<<CRLF>>you perform under these circumstances.
#14115FI want to bear witness to the strength of<<CRLF>>the people I've been watching all this<<CRLF>>time...to see their true potential.
#14115F...As I said, you may consider this a<<CRLF>>personal favor to me.<<CRLF>>
#14306F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14116FThere is little time remaining. Anything<<CRLF>>could happen at any moment.<<CRLF>>
#14116FI'm sorry to hurry you along, but may I<<CRLF>>ask you to leave Mt. Vesuvio right away?<<CRLF>>
#00100FSounds like this is our chance to finally<<CRLF>>bring everything to an end.<<CRLF>>
#00500FAnd we'll be right by your side, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FWe've come this far. We can't turn back<<CRLF>>now!<<CRLF>>
#00400FI don't know what's going to happen, but<<CRLF>>I don't want to have any regrets. Let's<<CRLF>>see this through.
#00306FYes. After coming this far, I could not<<CRLF>>even consider turning back.<<CRLF>>
#14301FAdol Christin...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14301FI leave the fate of this world in your<<CRLF>>hands. Please...take care.<<CRLF>>

#14115FPlease take care, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FOnce I'm certain Lord Eldeel is safe, I'll<<CRLF>>be right behind you.<<CRLF>>
#14001FAdol... Everyone...<<CRLF>>Please take care.<<CRLF>>
#14001FAdol... Everyone...<<CRLF>>Please take care.<<CRLF>>
#14306FAdol Christin...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14306FWhen I look at you and your companions,<<CRLF>>no matter how desperate this situation may<<CRLF>>be, I cannot help but feel a ray of hope.
#14301FI leave Celceta, and the fate of this world,<<CRLF>>in your hands.<<CRLF>>

#00109FWhat the...<<CRLF>>I thought we killed it!<<CRLF>>
#00408FIt's just like Sol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FIf we can't kill it with our current weapons,<<CRLF>>there's no reason to waste any more time<<CRLF>>fighting it. We should fall back for now.
#00101FWell, this is the place where we fought<<CRLF>>that monster that just wouldn't die.<<CRLF>>
#00501FIt's the north side of the battlefield.<<CRLF>>Right where the Roda Tree indicated...<<CRLF>>
#00101FHey, we've been here before, haven't<<CRLF>>we? This is the place where we ran into<<CRLF>>that monster that just wouldn't die.
#00501FIt's the north side of the battlefield.<<CRLF>>Right where the Roda Tree indicated...<<CRLF>>
#00305FIt appears that we have arrived at just<<CRLF>>the right time. <<CRLF>>
#00402FDon't think this is going to go like it did<<CRLF>>last time!<<CRLF>>
#00305FIt appears that we have arrived at just<<CRLF>>the right time. <<CRLF>>
#00402FIt's just like before...but we're ready for<<CRLF>>it this time. One way or another, we're<<CRLF>>getting past it!
#00309FSo that is a living weapon, unable to<<CRLF>>be destroyed through conventional<<CRLF>>means?
#00402FCome on, Adol! Stay alert!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThe only thing that can really damage<<CRLF>>it is that Artifact Sword you've got, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00101FOur best bet is to knock it out for a<<CRLF>>while, search for a weak point, then<<CRLF>>give it everything we've got!
#00500FWhew...<<CRLF>>We did it.<<CRLF>>
#00101FGuess we found the right place. This has<<CRLF>>to be the artifact laboratory!<<CRLF>>
#00300FIt seems likely we will encounter many<<CRLF>>more living weapons inside.<<CRLF>>
#00203FWe'll just have to leave those to Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00111F#0MUgh, the noisy little shrimp's back.<<CRLF>>Can't say I missed her!<<CRLF>>
#0MWhat was that, Duren? Say it again.<<CRLF>>I DARE YOU.<<CRLF>>
#00501FIf you're here, Nina, does that mean...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400F...! Leeza!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15104FW-well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15104FI saw something huge flying this way and<<CRLF>>hurried after it...<<CRLF>>
#00409FOh! Was it Sol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15101FI couldn't tell for sure.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15108FBut this is the only place I haven't<<CRLF>>checked, so if she's not here...<<CRLF>>
#00404F...Oh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWe're gonna have to explore this place<<CRLF>>either way, so if Leeza's here, that saves<<CRLF>>us the trouble of looking for her later.
#00100FCome on. Let's go inside.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FTread lightly, everyone...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

Let me know if there's anything you want.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I can do my work anywhere! They don't call me<<CRLF>>Gazock the Strong for nothing.<<CRLF>>
Well, if it isn't Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501F...Why is this person...in a place like<<CRLF>>this?<<CRLF>>
#00105FWell, let's just say he's no ordinary guy.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FDid you come here to explore the ruin,<<CRLF>>Gazock?<<CRLF>>
Yeah. My shoulders have started to stiffen up<<CRLF>>a little, though.<<CRLF>>
So I was wondering if there's anywhere in this<<CRLF>>area I could lie down for a spell.<<CRLF>>
#00200FActually, I think we know just the place!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Really? Great! Where is it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe party informed Gazock of the Roos' Nest and explained to him<<CRLF>>how to find it.<<CRLF>>
Hmm...a nest full of sacred beasts, huh?<<CRLF>>Sounds perfect!<<CRLF>>
#00100FYou heading there right now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
No, I think I'll rest here for a short while<<CRLF>>first.<<CRLF>>
So if there's anything you need, I'd be happy<<CRLF>>to provide my Super Handyman services. Just say<<CRLF>>the word!
#00309FPardon me for asking, but...how do you<<CRLF>>intend to do crafting without the appro-<<CRLF>>priate facilities?
Wahaha! What do you think this bag I've got<<CRLF>>is for?!<<CRLF>>
I can do my work anywhere! I'm Gazock the<<CRLF>>Strong, remember?!<<CRLF>>
#14001FI'm worried about Sol. Can we please<<CRLF>>hurry farther into the laboratory?<<CRLF>>

#00302FIf we don't stop him, our lives will be<<CRLF>>in danger.<<CRLF>>
#00501FLeeza, I'm sorry, but we're going to need<<CRLF>>to try to subdue him. Is that all right?<<CRLF>>
#14001FY-yes, of course! I have no desire to put<<CRLF>>anyone in any more danger.<<CRLF>>
#14002FPlease do what you must!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FAll right. Let's go, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14012FAre you all right, everyone?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FWe are fine. His attacks have ceased,<<CRLF>>but...<<CRLF>>
#00211FBut that's the best we can do.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111FYeah, he's as tough as he ever was,<<CRLF>>that's for sure.<<CRLF>>
#00404FWhat could have happened to him? He's<<CRLF>>never behaved like this before...<<CRLF>>
#00501FIt's almost as if he's possessed.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14001FSol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00109FAww crap, what's happening now?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402FLeeza! Stay back!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000F...It's all right. There's no reason to be<<CRLF>>afraid.<<CRLF>>
#00409FWha...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FHuh? He looks...familiar...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FYou've gotta be kidding me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FIt's...you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14301F#00992VWelcome, dear descendant. And welcome<<CRLF>>also to you, travelers of the Great Forest...<<CRLF>>
#14301F#00993VI am Lefance.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14301F#00994VThe former King of Celceta, and close<<CRLF>>friend of Eldeel's.<<CRLF>>
#14301FThank you for calming my distressed soul.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14306FIt is truly a strange feeling to be able to<<CRLF>>meet with those who live hundreds of<<CRLF>>years after my own time...
#00508FKing...Lefance...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00308FHow is this possible...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14305FMy body was lost eight hundred years<<CRLF>>ago when the Kingdom of Celceta fell.<<CRLF>>
#14300FHowever, my soul remained chained to<<CRLF>>this world, sealed away...<<CRLF>>
#14300FAnd upon my release, I lost all control.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FW-wow. This is...amazing...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FU-um... May I ask how you became<<CRLF>>trapped inside Sol?<<CRLF>>
#14300FAs I wandered this world, aimless and<<CRLF>>alone, I was drawn to a certain strong will.<<CRLF>>
#14001FStrong will?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14306FYours. The will of my descendant, and her<<CRLF>>stalwart wish to save my friend Eldeel.<<CRLF>>
#14012F#00639VAh...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00103FHaha. Well, she did come barreling in here<<CRLF>>all on her own just to find him, so I can<<CRLF>>definitely see what you mean!
#14010FD-Duren...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14301FYour ability to control the Sol-Galba I<<CRLF>>created may have also played a part.<<CRLF>>
#14301FI found myself guided toward it, and<<CRLF>>eventually wound up...inhabiting it.<<CRLF>>
#14300FHowever, I initially remained unable to<<CRLF>>control it, causing it to go berserk.<<CRLF>>
#14305FI apologize for any trouble this may have<<CRLF>>caused you.<<CRLF>>
#14000FU-um, King Lefance, actually...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14305F...Something has happened to Eldeel,<<CRLF>>has it not?<<CRLF>>
#14300FThe fact that my soul was released can<<CRLF>>mean only one thing.<<CRLF>>
#14300FThe black-winged one has manifested<<CRLF>>in this world again, just as he did eight<<CRLF>>hundred years ago.
#14009FH-how do you...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FIt was none other than myself who<<CRLF>>sealed the black-winged one away.<<CRLF>>
#14305FAnd as such, the fact that I have been<<CRLF>>released means that he, too, has been<<CRLF>>released.
#00109FWhat?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FThere is more that I must share with you,<<CRLF>>but I need not do so here. We can speak<<CRLF>>as we go.
#14301F...Though there is something else you<<CRLF>>must do before we leave this place, is<<CRLF>>there not?
#00509FY-yes. We need to find a way to repair<<CRLF>>the Mask of the Moon.<<CRLF>>
#14300FEight hundred years ago, the Mask of<<CRLF>>the Moon's magic was depleted, and its<<CRLF>>power lost.
#14300FHowever, the magic stored in the altar<<CRLF>>here should be sufficient to replenish it.<<CRLF>>
#00109FSo you can fix it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14305FI believe I can.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14301FVisitor to the forest, accepted by Eldeel...<<CRLF>>Your name is Adol, is it not?<<CRLF>>
#14301FPlace the Mask of the Moon upon the altar,<<CRLF>>Adol.<<CRLF>>
#14305FThis is not my area of expertise, but I<<CRLF>>will do what I can.<<CRLF>>
#00209FWow...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FAmazing!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FAh, the mask!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FIs it repaired?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14301FI was successful. Please, take this with<<CRLF>>you, Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSo now we can get inside the Temple of<<CRLF>>the Sun?<<CRLF>>
#14000FThank you so much for your assistance!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14306FThink nothing of it. But now you must<<CRLF>>hurry, as little time remains.<<CRLF>>
#14301FIf you wish to stop the black-winged one,<<CRLF>>you must proceed to the Temple of the<<CRLF>>Sun at once.
#14301FI will go on ahead. There is little I can do<<CRLF>>to help in battle, but I can at least serve<<CRLF>>as a guide.
#14009FOh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FAnd off he goes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIf he has sealed away the darkness from<<CRLF>>Eldeel's soul before, then we must trust<<CRLF>>that he will succeed once more.
#00209FBut how did he do it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00504FI imagine we'll find out soon enough.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FClearly, he has a lot more to tell us. And<<CRLF>>no matter what the situation, we need to<<CRLF>>hurry back to the Temple of the Sun.
#00502FNina!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#15100FYou called?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FCan you go and scout out the area<<CRLF>>around Elduke?<<CRLF>>
#15100FOkay!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FI'll be leaving with Sol. We'll meet again<<CRLF>>at the temple, Adol.<<CRLF>>
Take care.
Don't get into trouble.
#14003FThank you. Safe journey to you all!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14003FHeheh. I'll do my best not to.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00208FThat was a girl's scream, for sure.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402FIt seemed to be coming from above us...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FQuickly! Let's go!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp6330.JSON_TEXT 49 >>
#00101FLook, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FLeeza!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14012FAdol! Calilica!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Are you okay?
What happened?
#14004FI-I'm all right, thank you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FI-I'm afraid I don't quite know myself...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FI came to the outskirts to research my<<CRLF>>ancestors when suddenly, Sol just...<<CRLF>>stopped responding to my commands.
#14001FHe took off, brought me here, then threw<<CRLF>>me off his back.<<CRLF>>
#00408FThrew you off?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FWhy would he do that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FI'm afraid I don't know. This has never<<CRLF>>happened before...<<CRLF>>
#00402F#16SSol! What do you think you're doing?!<<CRLF>>What if Leeza had been hurt?!<<CRLF>>
#00402F#16SAnswer me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...Can he even talk?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#383c...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#383cWHERE...AM...I...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00112FWhoa. That, uh, answers that, I guess...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FWha...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14009FWas that...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#383cWHY...AM I...HERE...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00508FSol...can speak?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14012FB-but that's impossible!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14008F#16SSol, wait! WAIT!!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14012F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FHe has flown away.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FIt looks like he's headed to the other<<CRLF>>side of the facility.<<CRLF>>
#00402FAre you okay, Leeza?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14000FY-yes, I'm all right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14004FBut I have no idea what's going on.<<CRLF>>This is all so confusing...<<CRLF>>
#00109FSo, uh, I'm pretty sure I already know<<CRLF>>the answer, but...Sol's never spoken<<CRLF>>before now, has he?
#14004FNo, this is the first time he's ever said<<CRLF>>a word.<<CRLF>>
#14001F...I'm going after him. I have to.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FGo after him? ...What should we do,<<CRLF>>Adol?<<CRLF>>
Go with her.
Let her go.
#00500FThat's right. We were headed to the other<<CRLF>>side of the facility ourselves anyway, so<<CRLF>>please allow us to accompany you.
#00300FWe would be more than happy to do so.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FI don't think that's a very good idea.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FWe're already aware of enemies here that<<CRLF>>can't be hurt with conventional weapons.<<CRLF>>Leeza shouldn't wander around alone.
#00401FShe's right, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00405FWe have to go with her!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FLeeza, I'm sorry, but you're coming with<<CRLF>>us.<<CRLF>>
#14012FB-but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWe have our own reasons to explore this<<CRLF>>location, so it seems only logical that<<CRLF>>we work together in this.
#00500FHeehee. Besides which, we'd be happy<<CRLF>>to have you with us.<<CRLF>>
#00403FDon't fight it, Leeza. Like it or not, you're<<CRLF>>coming with us!<<CRLF>>
#14000F...All right. When you put it that way,<<CRLF>>how can I say no?<<CRLF>>
#14000FThank you, everyone.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp6341.JSON_TEXT 17 >>
#4CAdol's maximum HP increased by 10.
#00209FWas that...someone's memory?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FHe was talking to Lord Eldeel...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FAdol, could that have been...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Lefance
Eldeel
#00501FThat was my thought as well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FSo that's Leeza's ancestor...the founder<<CRLF>>of the Kingdom of Celceta...<<CRLF>>
#00500FMemories are generally first-person affairs,<<CRLF>>so that one likely belongs to the person<<CRLF>>with whom Lord Eldeel was speaking.
#00411FJudging by what they were discussing, it<<CRLF>>had to be King Lefance.<<CRLF>>
#00109FSeems like those two were pretty close.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FSo this is what the Roda Tree meant by<<CRLF>>experiencing Lefance's memories. I had<<CRLF>>no idea it would be so literal...
#00305FThere may be other locations ahead<<CRLF>>where his memories remain.<<CRLF>>
#00309F...Another of King Lefance's memories.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FSeems to have taken place right here,<<CRLF>>too.<<CRLF>>
#00201FWhich means there could still be others<<CRLF>>in the area.<<CRLF>>
#00500FI suspect you're right. We should keep<<CRLF>>an eye out for more as we go.<<CRLF>>
<< mp6341m.JSON_TEXT 24 >>
King Lefance
#0M...I'm impressed that you knew where to find<<CRLF>>me.<<CRLF>>
#14100F#0MShould you really be here now?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100F#0MYour five retainers are worried about your<<CRLF>>absence from the temple.<<CRLF>>
King Lefance
#0MAs the place where I first swore to become<<CRLF>>king, this is...the starting point of who I am now.<<CRLF>>
#0MThere's nowhere more suitable when I wish to<<CRLF>>think undisturbed.<<CRLF>>
#14106F#0MYou can be quite the troublesome<<CRLF>>monarch, disappearing every time <<CRLF>>you have something to think about.
King Lefance
#14406FHah! ...So, I heard about the tower. <<CRLF>>What inspired you to build one in <<CRLF>>such a place?
#14100FOh, nothing in particular. It's just a little<<CRLF>>retreat for myself. Perhaps...a place <<CRLF>>suitable for me to think undisturbed?
King Lefance
#14400FAre you intending to leave Elduke, then?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14106FOne day, yes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FI've told you before. I intend to leave the<<CRLF>>Kingdom of Celceta to mankind, once I <<CRLF>>feel mankind is ready to take care of her.
#14100FBut it is best to do so in stages. First,<<CRLF>>I shall leave the Temple of the Sun and<<CRLF>>lend support from behind the scenes.
King Lefance
#14400FYes, I recall you discussing that plan once<<CRLF>>before.<<CRLF>>
#14100FI intend to gradually move more and <<CRLF>>more into the background.<<CRLF>>
#14100FSo much so that one day, people will <<CRLF>>completely forget my existence...<<CRLF>>
#14103FAt which point I'll merely watch over <<CRLF>>them, living a life of peace and<<CRLF>>serenity. That's my plan, anyway.
King Lefance
#14401FI see. I would expect no less from you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FWell, wish me luck, old friend. I'm going <<CRLF>>off to work toward this 'retirement' of<<CRLF>>mine, bit by bit...

#0MHaha. Just resting for a moment.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FWhat're you trying to find here? It must<<CRLF>>be pretty damned important if you need<<CRLF>>this many soldiers to get it!
#12020FOh, I think you know.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FNow that he has the Mask of the Sun,<<CRLF>>there's only one thing left Lord Gruda<<CRLF>>still needs.
#12020FThe Mask of the Moon, formerly owned<<CRLF>>by King Lefance of Celceta...<<CRLF>>
#00101FI was afraid you'd say that.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FSo you're here for the same reason we<<CRLF>>are.<<CRLF>>
#12020FWell, there was always a chance such a<<CRLF>>legendary artifact may possess the same<<CRLF>>power as the Mask of the Sun.
#12026FFortunately, it seems his worries were in<<CRLF>>vain.<<CRLF>>
#00402FWh-what do you mean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12026F...We've already located the Mask of the<<CRLF>>Moon.<<CRLF>>
#12020FYou were right in thinking it's here on<<CRLF>>this mountain.<<CRLF>>
#00208FWhat...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FHowever, not only is it broken in half,<<CRLF>>it appears to have lost all of its former<<CRLF>>power. It's...just a decoration now.
#12026FAnd since we have no use for a broken<<CRLF>>shell of a mask, we just left it where it<<CRLF>>was.
#00501F(Broken? Does that mean...?)<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F(Most likely, yeah.)<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201F...So you're just going to let us have it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12026FIf you don't believe me, by all means,<<CRLF>>go and have a look for yourself!<<CRLF>>
#12020FThis whole excursion has been nothing<<CRLF>>but a huge waste of time. I have no de-<<CRLF>>sire to waste more. If you'll excuse me...
#00202FW-wait!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12011FWhat's happening...to my mask?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12024F#16S#2MGeh...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FRemnos! ...What's going on?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2E#833cI knew we couldn't trust you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2E#833cDid Lord Gruda not ask you to bring him the Mask<<CRLF>>of the Moon?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2E#833cIt may have lost its power, but you have your<<CRLF>>orders. Why aren't you following them?! It's<<CRLF>>not for you to decide what Lord Gruda wants!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208F...It's her.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FWeren't...you supposed to be at the<<CRLF>>temple...?<<CRLF>>
#0MDon't be coy with me. When you broke free<<CRLF>>of my spell all on your own, I knew you had<<CRLF>>potential.
#0MImagine my surprise when you suddenly pledged<<CRLF>>loyalty to Lord Gruda! And excelled beyond all<<CRLF>>expectations as leader of the Masked Division...
#0MYour talents were great, and you needed no<<CRLF>>coaxing to help us. It's like you were the<<CRLF>>perfect lackey. A little too perfect...
#12026FHaha. I never thought I'd hear you<<CRLF>>compliment me so highly. I'm honored!<<CRLF>>
#10401FDon't mock me. I knew I couldn't let my<<CRLF>>guard down around you.<<CRLF>>
#10405FLately, I haven't even been able to read<<CRLF>>your thoughts...<<CRLF>>
#12021F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400FThat's why I decided...to tweak your<<CRLF>>mask.<<CRLF>>
#10401FI set it so that if you ever did anything<<CRLF>>that ran counter to our orders, it would<<CRLF>>take your life.
#00208FWHAT?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10405FAnd would you look at that? My little<<CRLF>>modification just...kicked...in.<<CRLF>>
#10401FYou were thinking of giving the Mask of<<CRLF>>the Moon to them, weren't you?<<CRLF>>
#00209F...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12026F#00913V*sigh*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12020FI was doing so well, too. I can't believe I<<CRLF>>let my guard down at the last moment.<<CRLF>>
#00209FRemnos...you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThe Masked Division is approaching!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhoa, hold on, now. Are you telling me<<CRLF>>that everything Remnos has been doing<<CRLF>>this whole time was...
#00501FA ruse, it would seem. He pretended<<CRLF>>to obey Gruda, all the while gathering<<CRLF>>information to use against him.
I never doubted you for a minute!
You had me completely fooled.
#12026FHaha, really? I thought my acting was<<CRLF>>fairly splendid, if I do say so myself.<<CRLF>>
#12026FHaha. I'm happy to hear it. I thought my<<CRLF>>acting was fairly splendid.<<CRLF>>
#10402FSilence!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10401FHow dare you betray me! How dare you<<CRLF>>bring shame upon me like this!<<CRLF>>
#10401FThe spell I cast upon your mask will<<CRLF>>squeeze the life out of you, bit by bit,<<CRLF>>until the pressure finally ends you.
#10402FBut don't worry, your dear sister will be<<CRLF>>joining you on your trip to the underworld!<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhere did she go?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00402FI bet to recover the Mask of the Moon!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWe must dispatch these soldiers and<<CRLF>>pursue.<<CRLF>>
#00502F#16SWatch out, Adol!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThat was the last of them.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12025FAgh...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SRemnos!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FWe'll find a way to get you out of this...<<CRLF>>I swear we will!<<CRLF>>
#12021F#2WKar...na...<<CRLF>>Go...after...Bami...<<CRLF>>
#12021F#2WIf...she gets...the Mask...of the Moon...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00204FB-but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Man's Voice
If you want to save him, you'd better hurry.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FAh...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FLeo...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12026F#2WHey there...Leo...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FHmph. Not so tough now, are you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202FW-we can save him? How?! Tell me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FThe only way to break Bami's curse is <<CRLF>>to stop it at the source.<<CRLF>>
#10001F...In other words, you're going to have<<CRLF>>to take her down.<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhere'd you hear that?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10501FWe overheard some of the guards talking <<CRLF>>about it when we were sneaking by.<<CRLF>>
#10002FYES! Exactly! We were listening in to the<<CRLF>>enemy's communications. It was genius<<CRLF>>intelligence gathering at its finest!
#00402FWe're really gonna have to hurry.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FBoth to find the mask, and to save <<CRLF>>Remnos...<<CRLF>>
#00209FCalilica...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FGo. As fast as you can.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FEverything this man has done has been for <<CRLF>>the sake of his homeland. He's been <<CRLF>>pretending to obey Bami from the start.
#10001FTrying to solve the mystery of the mask<<CRLF>>so he could pass that information on to<<CRLF>>you, eventually...
#00209FWh-what?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#12026F#2WHaha. So you...knew all along...did you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FMuch as I hate to admit it, he's a <<CRLF>>chivalrous warrior.<<CRLF>>
#10001FLeave him to me. I'll look after him until <<CRLF>>you return.<<CRLF>>
#00200FCommander Leo...<<CRLF>>Thank you.<<CRLF>>
We owe you one.
What brought this on?
#10006FTh-there's no need to thank me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10006FH-hmph. I'm only doing what's right. It's<<CRLF>>what any good commander would do.<<CRLF>>
#10005FJust go and get the Mask of the Moon <<CRLF>>and open the temple door already!<<CRLF>>
#10005FOtherwise we won't be able to continue <<CRLF>>trailing Gruda.<<CRLF>>
#10603FLook, he's blushing!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10500FI'm not surprised. People usually complain <<CRLF>>to him, or just straight up insult him. He<<CRLF>>doesn't get thanked very often.
#10002F#16SSILENCE!! That's an order!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001F...We're going to need to take him<<CRLF>>somewhere safe.<<CRLF>>
#00500FHow about the Roos' Nest near Elduke?<<CRLF>>It's not far from here at all.<<CRLF>>
#00100FYeah, that'd be your best bet, I think.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CDuren described to Leo the exact location of the Roos' Nest.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FVery well. We'll be waiting for you there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10000FNow hurry along, Adol. You've got no <<CRLF>>time to waste!<<CRLF>>
#00500FLet's go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FRemnos... I'll take her down and break <<CRLF>>this curse myself. I won't let anything<<CRLF>>happen to you.
#12020F#2WKarna... Adol...<<CRLF>>Take...care...<<CRLF>>
<< mp6345.JSON_TEXT 62 >>
#10405FNow this area is all that remains...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#16SStop right there, Bami! We'll be<<CRLF>>taking the Mask of the Moon!<<CRLF>>
#00300FWe've finally caught up with you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10400FHee, if it isn't Remnos' sister. What do<<CRLF>>you think you can do to me when you<<CRLF>>can't even handle little Remnos?
#00101F#0M...I see you're as unpleasant as ever.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FRelying on the masks, manipulating <<CRLF>>the innocent to do your bidding, <<CRLF>>following Gruda without question...
#00202FEverything you have, everything you are,<<CRLF>>is borrowed from someone else. You<<CRLF>>don't scare me. You're just a coward.
#10401FHow dare you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205F...I'll admit to being a little frustrated <<CRLF>>when I found out about Remnos'<<CRLF>>abilities.
#00205FIt felt like all my struggles amounted<<CRLF>>to nothing. Like I was doomed to be<<CRLF>>in second place from the very start.
#00201FBut Remnos always fought alone, with<<CRLF>>his own strength and wits. He never<<CRLF>>flaunted them. He never used others.
#00202FI'm proud to call myself his sister, and<<CRLF>>embarrassed to think I could ever be<<CRLF>>jealous of him for a single moment.
#10405FAnd yet that strong, courageous brother<<CRLF>>of yours still lost to me. So what does<<CRLF>>that tell you about your chances?
#00201FRemnos didn't lose to you. He lost to<<CRLF>>one of your cheap tricks.<<CRLF>>
#00201FAnd you only relied on those cheap tricks<<CRLF>>because you knew you couldn't defeat him<<CRLF>>if you didn't.
#10405FWhat a foolish way to view the situation.<<CRLF>>The last one standing is always the victor,<<CRLF>>no matter how that victory was achieved.
#10402F#16SAnd as you're about to learn, I will <<CRLF>>always be the last one standing!<<CRLF>>
#00508FAnother mask?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00508FThat's just like the one Gadis wore!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FIs she...still human? Her form...is<<CRLF>>monstrous!<<CRLF>>
#00300FWe seem to have no choice but to fight...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F#0MSo you're going to rely on cheap tricks<<CRLF>>to the bitter end?<<CRLF>>
#833c#2MAs long as I kill you all here, the Mask of the<<CRLF>>Moon will be mine. And then I'll have no need<<CRLF>>for Remnos anymore, either.
#833c#2MAllow me to show you how powerless you truly<<CRLF>>are!<<CRLF>>
#833c#00710V#2MHahahaha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#833c#00712V#2M#18SHaaaahahahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00202F*huff* We... We did it...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FAnd with that, the curse on Remnos should<<CRLF>>now be broken. Congratulations, Karna.<<CRLF>>You've both found and saved him.
#00206FEveryone...thank you all so much.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FNow let's go get the Mask of the Moon!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThere is an altar of some kind over there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FLet's take a closer look.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FThere seems to be another altar over there.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FIt looks just like the one in the Lake<<CRLF>>Tolmes Ruins.<<CRLF>>
#00500FLet's take a closer look.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CAdol's base STR increased by 1.
#00401F...So it was Lord Eldeel himself who<<CRLF>>created the Mask of the Moon?<<CRLF>>
#00209FHe seemed to be arguing with King<<CRLF>>Lefance about it, but I couldn't quite catch<<CRLF>>what the cause of the dispute was.
#00500FIf we knew that, we'd be considerably<<CRLF>>closer to finding some means of stopping<<CRLF>>Gruda.
#00111FI wish we could just ask Lord Eldeel<<CRLF>>directly. That would make things so<<CRLF>>much easier.
#00305FCould there be anyone else around who<<CRLF>>is familiar with what happened back then?<<CRLF>>
#00111FWell, there's the Roda Tree, but it...he?...<<CRLF>>didn't seem to know any more than what<<CRLF>>we were already told.
#00404FThat just leaves King Lefance.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FYes. How unfortunate that the dead are<<CRLF>>not likely to provide many answers when<<CRLF>>questioned.
#00500FFor now, let's just see what's inside that<<CRLF>>chest.<<CRLF>>
#00109FThis is the Mask of the Moon? It's kinda...<<CRLF>>in terrible shape...<<CRLF>>
#00209FLooks like Remnos was right when he<<CRLF>>said it was snapped in half.<<CRLF>>
#00300FThe Roda Tree did mention feeling<<CRLF>>an energy source from two different<<CRLF>>locations.
#00408FWe might find the second half in the<<CRLF>>other location, then.<<CRLF>>
#00501FThat would be the Lake Tolmes Ruins.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FI guess we know where we're headed<<CRLF>>next!<<CRLF>>
#00209FThis is the other half of the Mask of the<<CRLF>>Moon?<<CRLF>>
#00109FLooks that way.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FYeah, its design is identical to what we<<CRLF>>found in the Lake Tolmes Ruins.<<CRLF>>
#00409FIf you hold the two halves together, it<<CRLF>>does make a full mask. No more miss-<<CRLF>>ing pieces, at least.
#00401FBut how do we reattach them? Just<<CRLF>>smacking them into each other doesn't<<CRLF>>exactly seem to be doing anything!
#00305FAs it is right now, it seems little more<<CRLF>>than a broken antique.<<CRLF>>
#00501FMaybe Remnos knows something.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FOh, yeah, maybe! He should be awake<<CRLF>>by now, I'd think.<<CRLF>>
#00500FAll right, then.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FLet's go back to the Roos' Nest and<<CRLF>>check up on Remnos.<<CRLF>>
#4CThe altar-like structure nearby seems<<CRLF>>suspicious. It would probably be best to<<CRLF>>examine it closely before leaving.
<< mp6345m.JSON_TEXT 13 >>
#14409FThe Mask of the Moon?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14105FIndeed. Think of it as the Mask of the <<CRLF>>Sun's counterpart. Its...twin.<<CRLF>>
#14105FNaturally, I wasn't able to replicate the<<CRLF>>Mask of the Sun completely, but...<<CRLF>>
#14409FWhy would you create such a thing? <<CRLF>>And why give it to me?!<<CRLF>>
#14105F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14400FIs the Mask of the Sun not an artifact of <<CRLF>>divine power, created through arts men <<CRLF>>have long been forbidden to possess?
#14101FIt is as you say.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14400FForgive my impertinence, then, but did<<CRLF>>you not already state your wish to leave<<CRLF>>the Kingdom of Celceta to mankind?
#14400FWould this not go directly against those<<CRLF>>wishes?<<CRLF>>
#14104FI have expressed that desire, yes. <<CRLF>>However, I've been forced to change<<CRLF>>my plans a bit.
#14100FAs such, I'd like you to accept this, my<<CRLF>>friend.<<CRLF>>
#14100FI would prefer if you never had to use <<CRLF>>it...but I must prepare for the worst.<<CRLF>>
#14100FI'll explain further another time.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp6362.JSON_TEXT 1 >>
#4CWater is leaking through cracks in the wall.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp6363.JSON_TEXT 18 >>
#4CAdol's maximum HP increased by 10.
#00309FWas that...someone's memory?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FHe was talking to Lord Eldeel...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00509FAdol, could that have been...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Lefance
Eldeel
#00501FThat was my thought as well.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FSo that's Leeza's ancestor...the founder<<CRLF>>of the Kingdom of Celceta...<<CRLF>>
#00505FYou shouldn't tease, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FMemories are generally first-person affairs,<<CRLF>>so that one likely belongs to the person<<CRLF>>with whom Lord Eldeel was speaking.
#00401FJudging by what they were discussing, it<<CRLF>>had to be King Lefance.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSeems like those two were pretty close.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FSo this is what the Roda Tree meant by<<CRLF>>experiencing Lefance's memories. I had<<CRLF>>no idea it would be so literal...
#00305FThere may be other locations ahead<<CRLF>>where his memories remain.<<CRLF>>
#00309F...Another of King Lefance's memories.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FTo think an old memory like this had<<CRLF>>taken place in the very spot we stand<<CRLF>>now.
#00200FWhich means there could still be others<<CRLF>>in the area.<<CRLF>>
#00500FI suspect you're right. We should keep<<CRLF>>an eye out for more as we go.<<CRLF>>
<< mp6363m.JSON_TEXT 28 >>
#14106FIt has been quite some time since we<<CRLF>>were last able to meet in private like this.<<CRLF>>
#14100F...Your Highness.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
King Lefance
#0MPlease don't mock me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI've never been fit to be king.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MAnd I'm still nowhere near ready to be<<CRLF>>addressed as such. I believe I've told you<<CRLF>>that several times already.
#0M...Ever the cruel one you are, Eldeel.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14100FHaha. I could say exactly the same to<<CRLF>>you.<<CRLF>>
#14106FI believe I've told you countless times as<<CRLF>>well that I'm not at all fit to be regarded<<CRLF>>as a god.
#14100FAnd yet you scold me every time I say<<CRLF>>so.<<CRLF>>
King Lefance
#14406F...I shall have to concede defeat on that<<CRLF>>one.<<CRLF>>
#14400FStill, I don't feel it quite appropriate to<<CRLF>>compare a human such as I with a god<<CRLF>>such as you.
#14400FAnxiety, impatience, envy... As long as<<CRLF>>I'm mortal, I must continue to experience<<CRLF>>the many dark emotions of humans.
#14400FI can't help but get a bit snippy on<<CRLF>>occasion...even in the presence of the<<CRLF>>only man I trust.
#14109F...That's quite the conniving defense.<<CRLF>>You leave me little to say in response.<<CRLF>>
King Lefance
#14401FHaha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Eldeel and King Lefance
Eldeel and ???
#16S#2MHahahahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14101FI may lack many human emotions. That,<<CRLF>>I am forced to admit.<<CRLF>>
#14101FHow does it feel to have such negative<<CRLF>>emotions?<<CRLF>>
#14104F...Perhaps like...another person has<<CRLF>>emerged within you?<<CRLF>>
King Lefance
#14400FAnother person, you say?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14400FI suppose you could phrase it like that...<<CRLF>>though it's a rather unusual turn of phrase.<<CRLF>>
#14100FI-I suppose it is. Haha...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
<< mp6364.JSON_TEXT 6 >>
#00407FUlgh!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00404FWh-what's that stench?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOof... It's awful!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00205FI feel like it's...choking me...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FHmm... It seems to be originating from<<CRLF>>deeper within the ruins.<<CRLF>>
#00501FWell, we certainly can't turn back on<<CRLF>>account of an unpleasant smell. Come on.<<CRLF>>Let's just keep moving.
<< mp6365.JSON_TEXT 119 >>
#4CAdol's base DEF increased by 1.
#00304F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FSo the Spardas from Selray originally<<CRLF>>came from here, huh?<<CRLF>>
#00305FAdol. Duren. I...I think I finally<<CRLF>>understand.<<CRLF>>
#00109FHuh?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FI think I finally understand what my<<CRLF>>tribe...what my mother and father<<CRLF>>sought to protect.
#00304FAnd the purpose behind the laws they<<CRLF>>defended.<<CRLF>>
#00109FThe ones about raising them?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...Our laws forbid us from telling others<<CRLF>>about the nature of the Spardas or the<<CRLF>>methods used to rear them.
#00300FBecause if others should discover these<<CRLF>>methods, the tragedy we just witnessed<<CRLF>>may very well occur again.
#00109FMakes sense. Explains what King Lefance<<CRLF>>said, too...<<CRLF>>
#00105F...about the Selray chief's pledge...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FGuess that's why they stopped mention-<<CRLF>>ing the poison to anyone.<<CRLF>>
#00300FIt appears so.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00304FMy ancestors sought to avoid repeating the<<CRLF>>past by keeping the Spardas close and<<CRLF>>stressing their sanctity as 'sacred beasts.'
#00305FI believe that is the true purpose behind<<CRLF>>the laws of my tribe.<<CRLF>>...However...
#00100FHmm? Something else bothering you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FThere is. The sight we see before us...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FThese Spardas are living in complete<<CRLF>>harmony with nature.<<CRLF>>
#00306FThis is the Spardas' natural habitat. The<<CRLF>>way they are meant to live.<<CRLF>>
#00300F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2E#833cHahaha. Why do you care?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FGadis!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10300FSo you found out what these big dumb<<CRLF>>animals are really like. Big deal!<<CRLF>>
#10302FYour people ain't gonna do a thing<<CRLF>>different, and you know it!<<CRLF>>
#00300F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10306FYou're gonna go back home and go right<<CRLF>>back to snappin' their tusks off and makin'<<CRLF>>'em do all your dirty work.
#10302FThe only thing keepin' people and beasts<<CRLF>>together is fear. Man ain't gonna live side<<CRLF>>by side with 'em unless he takes charge!
#00302F#2MNo! Beasts have their own sense of<<CRLF>>dignity, just as people do!<<CRLF>>
#00305F#2MThere is no reason we cannot search for<<CRLF>>a means of coexistence that allows both<<CRLF>>parties to preserve that dignity!
#00305F#2M...The laws of Selray were indeed written<<CRLF>>with human convenience in mind.<<CRLF>>
#00305F#2MBut...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00302F#16S#2MI am in a position to change those<<CRLF>>laws!<<CRLF>>
#00209FOzma...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FWow...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10310F...Hmph. Well, now you've done it. Ya<<CRLF>>made me mad enough that I'm seein' red.<<CRLF>>
#10310FPeople like you make me sick!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10308F#16SSo now...I'm gonna smash your<<CRLF>>damned heads in!<<CRLF>>
#00508F#1MThat's...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F#1MOne of Gruda's masks?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2MMy orders are to finish off the rats runnin'<<CRLF>>around Celceta and gettin' in everybody's way.<<CRLF>>
#2MAnd I love squashin' me some rats!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FWh-whoa...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00208FIt's...grotesque...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#833c#2MHahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#833c#2MIt's a special mask designed to strengthen your<<CRLF>>mind and body to the maximum.<<CRLF>>
#833c#18S#2MAnd I'm gonna use it to splatter you<<CRLF>>lot across the lake!<<CRLF>>
#00208FIt's just like when we fought Bami...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#833c#2MHahaha!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#833c#18S#2MI'm gonna splatter you lot across<<CRLF>>the lake!<<CRLF>>
#00305FWe...won...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FLooks like his body couldn't handle the<<CRLF>>mask's side effects after all.<<CRLF>>
#00100F...I guess congratulations are in order,<<CRLF>>Ozma. You accomplished what you set<<CRLF>>out to do.
#00305F#00355VI...am not done yet.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FNow that I know Gruda and his allies<<CRLF>>possess such extraordinary power, I<<CRLF>>feel I must aid in stopping him.
#00300FI want to continue fighting by your side,<<CRLF>>Adol.<<CRLF>>
#00301FOnly when this matter is fully settled will<<CRLF>>I be comfortable returning to Selray.<<CRLF>>
Are you sure?
Thanks!
#00305FI have come this far. Please, allow me<<CRLF>>to stay with you until the end.<<CRLF>>
#00300FI fear Gruda's actions pose a threat to<<CRLF>>the whole of Celceta, and I cannot sit idly<<CRLF>>by while this land I love is threatened.
#00103FThat's the spirit! Glad to have you on<<CRLF>>board.<<CRLF>>
#00305FI should be the one thanking you.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FI could not have come this far alone.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00301FYou have my deepest gratitude, Adol<<CRLF>>Christin.<<CRLF>>
#00103FWell, glad to have you with us!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00203FYep!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FIt's been a pleasure fighting by your side.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FHeehee. I would agree.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOh yeah, Adol...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FWhat's that altar-like thing over there?<<CRLF>>It's been bugging me since we got here.<<CRLF>>
#00501FWe should take a closer look.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FDoesn't that altar-like thing over there<<CRLF>>look familiar? It's been bugging me<<CRLF>>since we got here.
#00501FIt looks like the one we saw on Mt.<<CRLF>>Vesuvio. Let's take a closer look.<<CRLF>>
#00208FWhoa! Look!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...I guess this must be the source of that<<CRLF>>awful smell.<<CRLF>>
#00404FThe water outside is so clean, too...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FWhat is the purpose of this area, Frieda?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FIt's the source of all the Primeval Lands'<<CRLF>>water.<<CRLF>>
#00404FThe source of all the Primeval Lands'<<CRLF>>water?! But it's filthy!<<CRLF>>
#00505FShh. It's about to begin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300F...What is?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FA-are those...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FHold on, aren't those Spardas?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FThat's right. The sacred beasts Eldeel<<CRLF>>sent to this land.<<CRLF>>
#00500FAnd you're about to witness what makes<<CRLF>>them so sacred.<<CRLF>>
#00409FAmazing...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FI have never heard them cry like this<<CRLF>>before...<<CRLF>>
#00203FHaha. It's like they're singing!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00409FWhat's that red liquid?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FOh, whoa, it's...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FThe very poison we encountered in<<CRLF>>Selray. ...But why? No one is threatening<<CRLF>>them...
#00308F#16SThe water...<<CRLF>>It is...turning clear!<<CRLF>>
#00109FWhat's going on?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00505FCelceta was once thought to be a<<CRLF>>barren place where nothing could grow.<<CRLF>>
#00500FIt was then that Lord Eldeel sent the<<CRLF>>Spardas, who transformed this wasteland<<CRLF>>into a lush forest overflowing with life.
#00500FAnd even now, they're responsible for<<CRLF>>purifying the waters of the Great Forest.<<CRLF>>
#00308F...Purifying it?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00308FThat red liquid...is not poison?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FPoison? I'm afraid I don't know exactly<<CRLF>>how the process works...<<CRLF>>
#00500FBut what I do know is that the water<<CRLF>>they purify eventually flows into the river,<<CRLF>>which carries it to every part of the land.
#00500FThe Spardas are effectively the guardians<<CRLF>>of all life in Celceta.<<CRLF>>
#00309F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109F...A mask?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00209FCould this be the Mask of the Moon?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FMaybe. It's hard to tell.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00504FHmm... It's broken in two. And I sense<<CRLF>>no power emitting from it. It's clearly<<CRLF>>no match for the Mask of the Sun.
#00100FWell, can't hurt to take it with us,<<CRLF>>either way.<<CRLF>>
#00109FThis is just like the fragment we found<<CRLF>>at Mt. Vesuvio.<<CRLF>>
#00501FWhich means we now have both halves<<CRLF>>of the Mask of the Moon.<<CRLF>>
#00401FIt does seem like we have the whole<<CRLF>>thing now. Hold the two halves together,<<CRLF>>and they fit perfectly.
#00404FBut how are we supposed to reattach<<CRLF>>them, and get its power back?<<CRLF>>
#00300FIs this the Mask of the Moon for<<CRLF>>certain?<<CRLF>>
#00205F...If it is, how would we even know?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00200FMaybe we should go ask the Grand Roo<<CRLF>>and the Roda Tree.<<CRLF>>
#00100FSounds like a plan to me!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00500FThey do seem more likely to know the<<CRLF>>answers than anyone else.<<CRLF>>
#00305FLet us go, then. Time is of the essence.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CThe altar-like structure nearby seems suspicious. It would probably<<CRLF>>be best to examine it closely before leaving.<<CRLF>>
<< mp6365m.JSON_TEXT 27 >>
#14400FThe Kingdom of Celceta could not have<<CRLF>>come into existence were it not for the<<CRLF>>Spardas.
#14400FI doubt anyone who looked at this land<<CRLF>>for the first time could possibly imagine<<CRLF>>it was once an infertile wasteland.
#14106FDid you not call me here today as you<<CRLF>>wished to discuss something?<<CRLF>>
#14100FYou have 'worry' written all over your<<CRLF>>face.<<CRLF>>
#14400FHmph. I can't keep anything from you,<<CRLF>>can I?<<CRLF>>
#14106FYou're far too easy to read, my friend.<<CRLF>>I could do so in my sleep. *yawn*<<CRLF>>
#14400F...My worry is related to the Spardas.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14400FTheir purifying abilities are far too potent,<<CRLF>>and act as a deadly poison in the natural<<CRLF>>world.
#14405FIt is for this reason that I forbade anyone<<CRLF>>to remove Spardas from their natural<<CRLF>>habitat.
#14400FBut several days ago, some of the<<CRLF>>villagers from Selray broke that law and<<CRLF>>took a group of Spardas to the river.
#14109FOh, my... What could they possibly have<<CRLF>>done that for?<<CRLF>>
#14405FThey intend to use them in conflict<<CRLF>>between the villages there.<<CRLF>>
#14101F#16S...!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14405F#2MRegrettably, by the time I'd learned this,<<CRLF>>the poison had already been released and<<CRLF>>a village at the basin was destroyed.
#14104F#2M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14104F#2MHow tragic...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14410F#2MWhy must we humans keep repeating the<<CRLF>>same mistakes? Why must we abuse that<<CRLF>>which we're given in good faith?
#14101F...What have the people of Selray said<<CRLF>>regarding the matter?<<CRLF>>
#14400FIt seems this incident was a result of a<<CRLF>>small group of villagers acting<<CRLF>>independently.
#14400FThe village chief is currently working to<<CRLF>>take control of the situation.<<CRLF>>
#14400FHowever, it appears Selray too suffered<<CRLF>>damage.<<CRLF>>
#14405FI received a pledge from the village chief<<CRLF>>expressing his regrets for what happened<<CRLF>>and swearing never to allow it to recur.
#14101FI see... Then, my dear friend...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14105FMy answer to you now is the same as<<CRLF>>my answer when I resolved to cross<<CRLF>>the ocean.
#14400F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14103F...Let us watch over them.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14401F...Yes. I think that's best.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00509FSo this is the world of the Akashic<<CRLF>>Records...<<CRLF>>
#00109FI guess this Iris place is full of all kinds<<CRLF>>of information about our world, huh?<<CRLF>>
#00401FThat must mean your embarrassing<<CRLF>>future is recorded here too, Duren.<<CRLF>>
#00111FHey, my future's gonna be awesome!<<CRLF>>You just wait!<<CRLF>>
#00209FSo all the knowledge Eldeel gives to<<CRLF>>people comes from these records?<<CRLF>>
#00300FIf so, that raises a question.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FIf Lord Eldeel grants people knowledge,<<CRLF>>surely that means contradictions will<<CRLF>>arise between the records and reality, no?
#14305FThe records are not infallible; the world<<CRLF>>is merely guided by the events here.<<CRLF>>Unexpected events do occasionally occur.
#14305FI have heard Eldeel suggest that he gives<<CRLF>>knowledge to people in order to compen-<<CRLF>>sate such abnormalities.
#14300FAnd while his actions do create further<<CRLF>>contradictions, Eldeel corrects all of these<<CRLF>>himself using the Mask of the Sun.
#14300FThat is, as he sees it, his heavenly duty.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00408FSo he corrects abnormalities in the<<CRLF>>fabric of existence? Isn't that a lot of<<CRLF>>work and a huge responsibility?!
#00401FThis is the course of human history! You<<CRLF>>change one thing and it'll change another.<<CRLF>>How can one guy just deal with that?!
#14300FThat is a completely accurate assessment,<<CRLF>>yet there's no other who can perform such<<CRLF>>work. He has never once complained.
#00412F...I have to admit, that sounds like him. <<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00501FBut if the Mask of the Sun allows its<<CRLF>>wearer to correct the records...<<CRLF>>
#00101FYeah, we're in real trouble if we don't<<CRLF>>stop Gruda.<<CRLF>>
#14300FOn the highest level of Iris is the Central<<CRLF>>Area, where the device used to manipulate<<CRLF>>the records is located.
#14300FIt is safe to assume that Gruda will be<<CRLF>>moving toward that location.<<CRLF>>
#00501FHow do we get there?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00401FI can't see any stairs or anything...and<<CRLF>>there's nothing above us...<<CRLF>>
#14300FThe highest level of Iris is a vast distance<<CRLF>>above us. Even with stairs, it would be a<<CRLF>>lengthy and exhausting climb.
#14300FThe owner of the Mask of the Sun can<<CRLF>>warp directly.<<CRLF>>
#14305FBut others must silence the three guard-<<CRLF>>ians in order to ascend to the highest<<CRLF>>level.
#00209FGuardians?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300F...Ahead of us are three doors.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FEach leads to a different area: Bronze,<<CRLF>>Silver, and Gold.<<CRLF>>
#14300FWithin each area sits a guardian. When<<CRLF>>all three guardians have been defeated,<<CRLF>>the path to the center will open.
#00109FPretty tough security...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00300FDo we need to defeat the guardians in<<CRLF>>a specific order?<<CRLF>>
#14300FNo. Any order will do.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FHowever, we must reach Gruda before<<CRLF>>he finishes analyzing how to operate the<<CRLF>>device in the Central Area.
#00201FI feel like we've been saying this way too<<CRLF>>much, but...I guess there's no time to<<CRLF>>waste, then!

#14300FCorrect. It's from there the Akashic<<CRLF>>Records can be controlled.<<CRLF>>
#00501FThat's where Gruda would be, all right.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThis is it, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FHurry, now.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#14300FIf he begins interfering with the records,<<CRLF>>it will be too late.<<CRLF>>
#10235FSo...you've come, Adol Christin.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10231FI must be honest, I had not been<<CRLF>>expecting you to pursue me this far.<<CRLF>>
#10230FBut I must praise you for following your<<CRLF>>heart. It seems you're not all that differ-<<CRLF>>ent from me...
#00202FWh-what?! Adol is nothing like you!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10230FHah. He is exactly like me.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10230FHumans are highly inefficient creatures.<<CRLF>>One just has to look back at history to see<<CRLF>>the same mistakes made time and again.
#00300F...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10235FThey know what they must do and what<<CRLF>>the future demands for them, yet they<<CRLF>>ignore it, all to maintain the status quo.
#10235FThe number possessed of the will to dis-<<CRLF>>cover what is truly necessary and execute<<CRLF>>it forthwith is almost comically miniscule.
#10234F...Try to deny it all you'd like, but you<<CRLF>>know as well as I that I speak only<<CRLF>>the truth here.
#00404FY-you're...kinda right, I guess, but...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10234FBut even the most lax human seeks to<<CRLF>>survive. Threaten to take their life, and<<CRLF>>they will desperately act to preserve it.
#10234FThat, in essence, is what I am seeking<<CRLF>>to do.<<CRLF>>
#00501FGruda, you...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10235FOur ancestors sought to obtain the power<<CRLF>>of the gods for their own selfish ends.<<CRLF>>
#10231FBut not I! I seek it to test the potential<<CRLF>>of humanity. To test whether or not it<<CRLF>>even has the right to exist.
#10234FThat is the objective of the new genera-<<CRLF>>tion of Darklings. Now, Akashic Records<<CRLF>>and Mask of the Sun...

#00501FI don't know if that's possible, but looks<<CRLF>>that way. And if they're trying to get in<<CRLF>>our way, there's only one thing to do...

Adol's Father
#0MYou did well today, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MYeah. I'm fine.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2MThis is nothing!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Farm Lady
#1MBut you're still a child, so you need to take<<CRLF>>care of yourself.<<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#0MHaha. Your mother up in Heaven would never<<CRLF>>forgive me if you were to get hurt!<<CRLF>>
Adol
#2M...Daddy, who's that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#0MHmm? Oh, he's a traveling merchant.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MHe comes and stays here for a while, a few<<CRLF>>times each year.<<CRLF>>
Farm Lady
#1MHe has all kinds of interesting stories to tell.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#1MHe brings them to us like souvenirs. In place<<CRLF>>of actual souvenirs, most of the time!<<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MInteresting...stories?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#0MDo you want to hear some? We could go talk<<CRLF>>to him together, late--<<CRLF>>
#0M...Adol? Where did you go?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Farm Lady
#1MGracious, he even left his basket behind!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#1MHeheh. He's usually such a serious boy, but it<<CRLF>>seems he's still his father's child!<<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#0MHa. I certainly hope he doesn't take after me<<CRLF>>too much!<<CRLF>>
Hunter
#0MSo what happened to the princess after that?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Elderly Merchant
#1MOh, it was awful. I'm afraid she met a most<<CRLF>>untimely end...<<CRLF>>
#1M...Ah, you've come back to listen again?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Farmhand
#0MOh, it's you, Adol. Shouldn't you be in bed<<CRLF>>by now?<<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MWhere did that princess live?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Elderly Merchant
#1MFar away, on foreign shores.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MForeign...short? But...there isn't anywhere<<CRLF>>around here with a name like that...<<CRLF>>
Farmhand
#0MHaha. I guess the idea of a world outside your<<CRLF>>familiars is still a bit much for a young boy<<CRLF>>like you.
Elderly Merchant
#1MThe world outside this village is a vast place,<<CRLF>>filled with wonders.<<CRLF>>
For example...have you ever heard of the<<CRLF>>'ocean'?<<CRLF>>
Adol
#2M...Ocean?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Elderly Merchant
#1MThat's right. Let me tell you a tale of the<<CRLF>>ocean, and the pirates who roam it...<<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MOkay!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Farm Lady
#1MOh, Adol. Do you have some business outside<<CRLF>>the village?<<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MUh-huh. I'm gonna go pick some medicinal herbs.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Farm Lady
#1MReally? Well, don't be too long! It looks like<<CRLF>>it's going to start raining anytime now.<<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MNo problem!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2MSo...if I can't find one in the village, I'm<<CRLF>>sure I'll find one on the other side of the<<CRLF>>mountain...
#2M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2M  ...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2M    ...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2M      ...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2MHuh? There are just more mountains!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2MIt's so cold... Is this rain?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2M...*sniffle*<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#0MOh? What's this? A wild crybaby approaches!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MDaddy?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#0MAdol, I've been worried sick about you!<<CRLF>>What are you doing out here?<<CRLF>>
Adol
#2M...I was looking for the ocean. I thought<<CRLF>>there might be one on the other side of the<<CRLF>>mountain.
Adol's Father
#0M...Haha. Oh, dear!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MHonestly, you do take after me a little too<<CRLF>>much.<<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#1MWhat are you doing?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#0MDaddy...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI'm sorry! I saw these books and this map,<<CRLF>>and I...I...<<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#1MNo, it's okay, Adol. You don't need to apologize.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#0MDaddy?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#1M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#0M...A travel journalist?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MDoes that mean you wrote all these books,<<CRLF>>Daddy?<<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#1MThat's right. I traveled across a few nearby<<CRLF>>countries before finally settling in this<<CRLF>>village.
#1MLook at this map, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#1MIt's said that the beautiful white flowers that<<CRLF>>grow in this canyon only bloom one night a year.<<CRLF>>
Adol
#0M...Daddy?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#1MHmm?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#0MWhy did you become a travel journalist?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#1MWell, I...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#1MI suppose you could say I just wanted to see<<CRLF>>things with my own eyes.<<CRLF>>
Adol
#0M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Farm Lady
#1MSo you're really going to leave us, Adol?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MI'm sorry. I've made up my mind.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hunter
#1MWell, then, hurry up and get going!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#1M*sniffle* No one likes teary goodbyes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#0MHah!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MYou don't want to end up crying on the road<<CRLF>>like you did when you were a kid, do you?<<CRLF>>
#0M...So where will you be going first?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MI think I'll start by heading south. I want to<<CRLF>>brush up on my sword skills before venturing<<CRLF>>too far.
Adol's Father
#0M*sigh* I knew this day would come eventually,<<CRLF>>but...well...<<CRLF>>
#0MLet me just say one thing.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MI want you to swear you'll come back here one<<CRLF>>day. It doesn't matter when! Just...one day.<<CRLF>>
#0MIf you promise me that, and always remember<<CRLF>>you've got a home to come back to, you'll find<<CRLF>>the strength to overcome any obstacle.
#0MAnd I don't care how much time passes, you will<<CRLF>>always be welcome here.<<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MDad...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol's Father
#0MAnd...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#0MWhen your journey's complete, and you come<<CRLF>>back here for good, I'm sure you'll see things a<<CRLF>>lot differently than you do now.
So go and make lots of good memories, Adol.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#2M...Thanks, Dad.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2MTake care, everyone!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hunter
#1MYou too!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Farm Lady
#1MSend us a letter every now and again!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Adol
#2MAll right. I'm off!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4C'How long has it been since I arrived here?'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CLooking inside the forest, there was a familiar statue at the side of<<CRLF>>the path.<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol realized he had been this way already.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4C'How can I escape from this overgrown forest?'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4C'Where... Where am I?'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CMaps, books and models were scattered in disarray throughout a<<CRLF>>dimly lit room.<<CRLF>>
#4CAdol did not recognize a single one of them.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4C'I've been in this room once before...'<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#01037V#486c#0EI couldn't believe my ears when I heard<<CRLF>>that you repelled one of sis' knives with<<CRLF>>just your sword. She never misses.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#01036V#486c#0EI honor the skill and courage you have displayed<<CRLF>>by crossing the territory of the beasts.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#01034V#486c#0EYeah, he might not look like much, but<<CRLF>>his skill with a sword is really something.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#01035V#486c#0EYou'll have to fight me one-on-one<<CRLF>>sometime!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#2MSupposedly, a kingdom flourished in this forest<<CRLF>>about eight hundred years ago.<<CRLF>>
#2MThe ruins people find all over Celceta are<<CRLF>>somehow connected to it.<<CRLF>>
#2MWhat kind of kingdom was it? And what<<CRLF>>happened to it?<<CRLF>>
#2MI've been trying to find answers to these<<CRLF>>questions by investigating every ruin I come<<CRLF>>across, and reading up on all the old legends.
#2MIt is said that the Spardas which live in this<<CRLF>>area originally came from the Primeval Lands.<<CRLF>>
#2MThe Spardas are sacred beasts, bestowed upon<<CRLF>>this world by God...<<CRLF>>
#2MThere are some who say God resides in the<<CRLF>>Primeval Lands even now. But since no one can<<CRLF>>get there, no one really knows...

#00109FOh boy, this is some storm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00309FIt shows no signs of subsiding, and there<<CRLF>>is no shelter to be found in the plains.<<CRLF>>
#00209FSo this is the Sanctuary of Storms...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00201FIf we step out there, we'll be fried in no<<CRLF>>time!<<CRLF>>
#00111FYeah. I can see the tower on the other<<CRLF>>side, but actually getting to it alive seems<<CRLF>>kinda unlikely...
#00300FThere appear to be several strange<<CRLF>>objects scattered across the plains.<<CRLF>>
#00209FOh, you're right. I wonder what they're<<CRLF>>for.<<CRLF>>
#00100F#1MI dunno, but we're not getting any closer<<CRLF>>to the tower just standing here.<<CRLF>>
#00100F#1MCome on, Adol. Let's suck it up and go<<CRLF>>have a look.<<CRLF>>
#00209F#1MA-are you sure? I really don't feel safe<<CRLF>>going out there...<<CRLF>>
#00100F#1MIt'll be fine! Just as long as we're careful<<CRLF>>and try to keep a low profile, we should...<<CRLF>>probably be okay. I think.
#00305F#1M...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FOkay, Calilica... Let's see what you've<<CRLF>>got.<<CRLF>>
#00411FHeehee. Watch and learn!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00400FSee those lightning conductors scattered<<CRLF>>across the plains?<<CRLF>>
#00209FThose things half-buried in the ground?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00411FYeah. I can activate them with my power.<<CRLF>>As long as one is standing, no lightning<<CRLF>>will strike the area around it.
#00400FBut it's only temporary, so we need to<<CRLF>>reach a new conductor and activate it<<CRLF>>before the previous one shuts down.
#00400FWe just have to repeat that process until<<CRLF>>we reach the tower.<<CRLF>>
#00109FDoes Leeza really come through here<<CRLF>>every time she goes to see Eldeel?!<<CRLF>>
#00400FNo, she has her own way of reaching<<CRLF>>the tower.<<CRLF>>
#00111FR-really?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00305FTime is short. We should go.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>

#00105FNo kidding...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
P-people!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I don't care who you are, hurry up and help<<CRLF>>me!<<CRLF>>
I told you to give it up already!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I have no intention of staying here and living<<CRLF>>with you monsters!<<CRLF>>
#00101F...Can she communicate with them or<<CRLF>>something?<<CRLF>>
Huh? How should I know?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm just yelling things at them because that's<<CRLF>>what you do when you're in a position like this!<<CRLF>>
#00512F...They really do seem to understand her,<<CRLF>>though. It's kind of...amazing.<<CRLF>>
W-well, I mean, I do appreciate you keeping me<<CRLF>>safe from the monsters outside...<<CRLF>>
I-I suppose I might consider coming back to see<<CRLF>>you sometime. Maybe.<<CRLF>>
Is that okay with you?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FWhoa. I think she actually managed to<<CRLF>>persuade them!<<CRLF>>
A-at any rate, I'm leaving now.<<CRLF>>Goodbye!<<CRLF>>
So who are you, anyway?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Why are you here? What are you planning to<<CRLF>>do to me?!<<CRLF>>
#00111F*sigh* Isn't it a bit late for that line of<<CRLF>>questioning?<<CRLF>>

Don't think you can get away with saying things<<CRLF>>like that just because I'm a girl! My punches<<CRLF>>really hurt, you know!
#00503F...Adol, there's a time and a place for<<CRLF>>your awful brand of humor, and this is<<CRLF>>neither.
#4CAdol apologized and explained the situation.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Pigeon asked you to come here?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That idiot! Why didn't he come and help me<<CRLF>>himself?!<<CRLF>>

#00111FWell, uh, how about we get you back to<<CRLF>>Danan, okay?<<CRLF>>
Hold on.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
If I go back with you, Pigeon will have to give<<CRLF>>you a reward, right?<<CRLF>>
#00100FHuh? What difference does that make?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
You. You've got a map, right? Let me see it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#4CRabbit took the map by force and briefly glanced at it.<<CRLF>>...Very, very briefly.<<CRLF>>
Okay, got it! As long as I know the way<<CRLF>>back, I'm fine.<<CRLF>>

#00505F...There she goes.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FYeah.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FMaybe she'll actually find her way back<<CRLF>>this time.<<CRLF>>

#10CGoodness gracious me, if it isn't a Roo!<<CRLF>>It is truly a most pleasant surprise to have<<CRLF>>you visit our humble abode.
#10CWe continue to be most grateful that you taught<<CRLF>>us the most invaluable skill of prostration.<<CRLF>>
#10CProstration is such a useful act, it is!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10CWhy, mere days ago, I was able to escape<<CRLF>>mortal peril by prostrating myself before a<<CRLF>>human whom I had inadvertently angered.
#10CWhile it is not sufficient to repay the<<CRLF>>immense debt of gratitude I owe to you,<<CRLF>>please accept this humble offering.
#10CWe would all be delighted to see you<<CRLF>>again, if it would please you to revisit us<<CRLF>>at your next available leisure.

#10C#2rBRRRIIBBTT...<<CRLF>>I WILL REMEMBER THIS!<<CRLF>>ACTUALLY I WILL FORGET.
#10CYou once said that you love humans, did you<<CRLF>>not?<<CRLF>>
#10CWe have finally come to understand<<CRLF>>that sentiment.<<CRLF>>

#10CGoodness gracious me, if it isn't a Roo!<<CRLF>>It is truly a most pleasant surprise to have<<CRLF>>you visit our humble abode.
#10CWe continue to be most grateful that you<<CRLF>>granted us the most invaluable gift of words.<<CRLF>>
#10CWords are such wondertabulous things!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10CIt remains somewhat of a mystery just how our<<CRLF>>leader's speech became this way, but words<<CRLF>>truly have opened up a new world for us.

#10CWe would all be delighted to see you<<CRLF>>again, if it would please you to revisit us<<CRLF>>at your next available leisure.
#10CIt truly is a mystery how our speech<<CRLF>>and the speech of our leader are so far<<CRLF>>removed from one another.
#10CWhy would such a development have<<CRLF>>occurred, pray tell? 'Tis a mystery with no<<CRLF>>solution. An eternal enigma...

<< sd4100.JSON_TEXT 75 >>
What, you got a problem?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Too bad, because you've got no right to<<CRLF>>complain!<<CRLF>>
Maybe it has something to do with the flowers<<CRLF>>blossoming here and there...but even if not,<<CRLF>>if I just had some time to think...
...Oh, never mind. Forget it.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Dammit, back again!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I just want to get out of here before those<<CRLF>>two explorers do...<<CRLF>>
#00109FAren't they...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hey, Rabbit.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
There must be some kind of trick here, just<<CRLF>>like there was on that Misty Peak.<<CRLF>>
Maybe it has something to do with the flowers<<CRLF>>blossoming here and there...<<CRLF>>
...Flowers? Who cares about flowers?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Look, if you've got something to say, just say<<CRLF>>it!<<CRLF>>
W-well...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
At this rate, this is just going to be what<<CRLF>>happened at the peak all over again.<<CRLF>>
We need to stop and think things through<<CRLF>>for a while.<<CRLF>>
...No.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
What?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Why not?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I was right, after all! If you'd just listened<<CRLF>>to me...<<CRLF>>
Let's make this perfectly clear, okay?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I'm the leader of this party.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
That means I'm the one who makes all the<<CRLF>>decisions.<<CRLF>>
And I'm the one whose opinions always get<<CRLF>>first priority.<<CRLF>>
And I'm the one who gets new equipment first.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And I'm the one who gets to start eating first.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And you're the one who gets to prepare the<<CRLF>>food.<<CRLF>>
U-um...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Do we have an understanding?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16SIt's one hundred million billion squillion<<CRLF>>years too early for you to be questioning<<CRLF>>my opinion!
...Is that even a number?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* This is getting us nowhere...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00109FAre they still at it? Don't they ever get<<CRLF>>tired of bickering?<<CRLF>>
#00105FOh well, let's just make sure we don't<<CRLF>>get dragged into it...<<CRLF>>
#10001FWhat? Isn't that peculiar statue the one<<CRLF>>we just...?<<CRLF>>
#10001FI knew it, we're back here again!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FCurses! Why? Why do we keep<<CRLF>>ending up back in the same place?!<<CRLF>>
#10604FSancho, how long have we been<<CRLF>>wandering in circles here?<<CRLF>>
#10505FMy sense of time has long gone, so<<CRLF>>no idea. But however long it's been, it's<<CRLF>>long enough to make me really hungry.
#10604FYeah. I don't think my stomach can last<<CRLF>>much longer either.<<CRLF>>
#10505FI'm losing the will to go on...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505FAt least if we were moving forward, we'd<<CRLF>>feel like we were getting somewhere. But<<CRLF>>just walking around in circles...
#10002FStop your complaining, you wimps!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FYou're hungry? You're losing the will to<<CRLF>>go on?! Those things are all in the mind!<<CRLF>>
#10005FYou shouldn't be so negative, that's<<CRLF>>your problem!<<CRLF>>
#10005FWhy can't you be like me and view things<<CRLF>>with a more positive spin?<<CRLF>>
#10002FWe might be lost now, but this is a<<CRLF>>perfect chance to strengthen our leg<<CRLF>>muscles!
#10005FYou should be grateful for this opportunity!<<CRLF>>We should thank the forest for allowing us<<CRLF>>to get lost within her leafy bosom!
#10604FY-you've got to be kidding...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505FBut...you were cursing at that statue just<<CRLF>>now, weren't you?<<CRLF>>
#10002FFOOLS! A real genius always strives for<<CRLF>>the truth! A man's thoughts are a swirling<<CRLF>>miasma! I was merely...thinking out loud!
#10601FR-really? Sancho, what do you think about<<CRLF>>all this?<<CRLF>>
#10509FWell, optimism isn't a bad thing,<<CRLF>>but...no, don't let him trick you!<<CRLF>>
#00111FThose three are really...something.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00100FI'm amazed they managed to get this far<<CRLF>>into the forest already!<<CRLF>>
#00100F...Let's keep moving.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FWhy are we back here again? Curse<<CRLF>>you, fiendish forest!<<CRLF>>
#10002FIs there even a way out of this place?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10005FThe absence of that statue suggests<<CRLF>>we're going in the right direction...<<CRLF>>
#10005FSo far, so good...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FBut which way should we go next?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10001FThat damned statue again...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10002FCurses! Why? Why do we keep<<CRLF>>ending up back here?!<<CRLF>>
#10505FFlowers? Hmm...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505FI think I heard about a type of flower<<CRLF>>that grows in the Great Forest as a<<CRLF>>guide for those who are lost.
#10501FI don't know if it was a real thing or<<CRLF>>just a fairytale, but...hmm...<<CRLF>>
#10501FThe Commander seems a bit touchy.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10505FI really hope I don't accidentally say<<CRLF>>anything to set him off.<<CRLF>>
#10501FBut seriously, what's up with this<<CRLF>>place?<<CRLF>>
#10505F*sigh* I want to go back to Casnan...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604FI'm starving...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#10604F...I wonder what those flowers over<<CRLF>>there taste like...<<CRLF>>
#10601FWe can make it this far without any<<CRLF>>problems...but if we go any farther, we<<CRLF>>always end up back in the same spot!
#10601FIf only there were some kind of sign<<CRLF>>showing us which way to go...<<CRLF>>
#10604FAll the Commander's shouting is just going<<CRLF>>to make him hungry.<<CRLF>>
#10601FHe should just be quiet for a little while.<<CRLF>>For all of our sakes.<<CRLF>>
<< sd4110.JSON_TEXT 64 >>
Not everything in life has just one right<<CRLF>>answer.<<CRLF>>
See? Aren't I smart?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But like I said, we don't have the TIME to be<<CRLF>>sitting around thinking!<<CRLF>>
Idiot, idiot, idiot!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
This ugly monument again...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Ugh, why can't I get out of this forest?!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Shut up! If I say we're going left, we're<<CRLF>>going left!<<CRLF>>
Being full of yourself really isn't helping us<<CRLF>>here...<<CRLF>>
It took us long enough to work out that you're<<CRLF>>supposed to head downhill...<<CRLF>>
*sigh* But she never listens when she gets like<<CRLF>>this. I'm just going to have to keep my mouth<<CRLF>>shut for a while, I guess.
We've been going around in circles for ages<<CRLF>>now.<<CRLF>>
Can we just stop and think about this for a<<CRLF>>minute? I'm sure there's got to be some way<<CRLF>>to work out the right path!
Hmm...maybe...I get the feeling that every time<<CRLF>>we end up back here it's because we went uphill.<<CRLF>>Which means...
If we keep going downhill, I bet that'll lead<<CRLF>>us out of here!<<CRLF>>
But...Rabbit, we need to go right here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've finally figured out the solution! We just<<CRLF>>have to keep heading downhill!<<CRLF>>
How long have I been wandering around this<<CRLF>>place now?<<CRLF>>
I should never have decided to follow those two<<CRLF>>explorers.<<CRLF>>
I managed to follow the trail of some explorers<<CRLF>>up to this point, but...I'm now completely lost.<<CRLF>>
I have to make sure to keep tailing them, since<<CRLF>>they're my only hope of getting out of here.<<CRLF>>
Hmm. Those two appear to have turned left.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Following from a distance is strangely rather<<CRLF>>tiring.<<CRLF>>
...Back again.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Those two are just as lost as I am.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Hmm...what to do...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Should I stop following them?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But if I do that, I'll be admitting defeat!<<CRLF>>...Plus, I'll be stuck here.<<CRLF>>
#00109FHey, aren't those two...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Listen, Pigeon.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who do you think you're talking to?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Who? You, of course. There's no one else here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16SThat's not what I mean.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#16SI'm the genius explorer, Rabbit Longears!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#18SYou're far too young and naive to<<CRLF>>be finding fault in my master plan!<<CRLF>>
Since when were you a genius explorer?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And what master plan?! You're just going off<<CRLF>>of instinct!<<CRLF>>
And how many times have you been saved<<CRLF>>by that brilliant instinct?<<CRLF>>
Don't you dare tell me you've forgotten about<<CRLF>>that!<<CRLF>>
About as many times it's got us into trouble.<<CRLF>>If not far fewer.<<CRLF>>
We really need to try to find some kind of<<CRLF>>pattern here if we ever hope to get out alive.<<CRLF>>
The paths that lead farther in must all have<<CRLF>>some common factor to them. If we can just<<CRLF>>figure out what that is...
#16SCheeky! Cheeky! You are so super-duper<<CRLF>>cheeky!<<CRLF>>
#16SAnd you're an idiot! Idiot idiot idiot!<<CRLF>>Um...IDIOT!!<<CRLF>>
*sigh* This is getting us nowhere...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...I guess they're explorers.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThey must be more skilled than they look<<CRLF>>to make it this far into the forest.<<CRLF>>
#00105FBut I get the feeling we should keep our<<CRLF>>distance. They don't seem like the type<<CRLF>>we want to get mixed up with.
#00109FHey, aren't those two...?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
But...Rabbit, we need to go right here!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
I've finally figured out the solution! We just<<CRLF>>have to keep heading downhill!<<CRLF>>
Shut up! We're going left!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
Come on, Rabbit, stop being stubborn and listen<<CRLF>>to reason already!<<CRLF>>
I'm really confident that I'm right here.<<CRLF>>Don't you want to get out of this Forest<<CRLF>>Labyrinth?
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
...I'd rather be lost than have you tell me<<CRLF>>what to do.<<CRLF>>
...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
And even if you're right, that might not be<<CRLF>>the only way. There might be more than one<<CRLF>>right answer here!
I'll find my own solution!<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
*sigh* It's like talking to a wall...<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00111F...Are they still here arguing?<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00105FOh well. Let's not get involved.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101F...I guess they're explorers.<<CRLF>><<CRLF>>
#00101FThey must be more skilled than they look<<CRLF>>to make it this far into the forest.<<CRLF>>
#00105FBut I get the feeling we should keep our<<CRLF>>distance. They don't seem like the type<<CRLF>>we want to get mixed up with.
